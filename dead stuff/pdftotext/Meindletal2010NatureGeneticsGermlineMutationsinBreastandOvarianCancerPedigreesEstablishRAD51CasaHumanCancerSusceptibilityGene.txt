Germline mutations in a number of genes involved in the recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. RAD51C is essential for homologous recombination repair, and a biallelic missense mutation can cause a Fanconi anemia­like phenotype. In index cases from 1,100 German families with gynecological malignancies, we identified six monoallelic pathogenic mutations in RAD51C that confer an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. These include two frameshift-causing insertions, two splice-site mutations and two nonfunctional missense mutations. The mutations were found exclusively within 480 pedigrees with the occurrence of both breast and ovarian tumors (BC/OC; 1.3%) and not in 620 pedigrees with breast cancer only or in 2,912 healthy German controls. These results provide the first unambiguous evidence of highly penetrant mutations associated with human cancer in a RAD51 paralog and support the `common disease, rare allele' hypothesis.
The breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2,
BRIP1 and PALB2 are essential in the genomic stability of cells and
have been functionally linked to the homologous recombination pathway of DNA repair1,2. Biallelic mutations in BRCA2, PALB2 and
BRIP1 are viable and cause a rare childhood chromosomal instability
disorder, Fanconi anemia (FA), characterized by  developmental
abnormalities, bone marrow failure and predisposition to leukemia and other cancers3,4. In an accompanying paper, we have identified
a homozygous missense mutation (R258H) in RAD51C as the causal

mutation in a family with three children severely affected by FAtypical birth defects5. Skin fibroblasts from the affected  person
showed cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and had impaired RAD51 foci formation after DNA damage5. These
features are typical hallmarks of FA cells with defects in BRCA2 (FANCD1)6 and PALB2 (FANCN)7,8 and reflect the essential role of FA proteins in homologous recombination repair2,3,9. Here we
have assessed whether monoallelic germline alterations in RAD51C
confer susceptibility to breast or ovarian cancer, or both, by screening
the RAD51C gene in 1,100 affected individuals from pedigrees with
gynecological cancers that were negative for mutations in BRCA1
and BRCA2.
In total, we detected 14 germline sequence alterations in RAD51C
in 1,100 unrelated affected women from pedigrees with hereditary
breast cancer and BC/OC: two single­base pair insertions, two splice-
site mutations and ten sequence alterations leading to single amino acid changes (Table 1). Three missense variants (A126T, G264S and
T287A) were identified frequently in affected individuals from unrelated pedigrees and also in healthy German controls10; the remaining missense alterations were unique for the respective pedigree. Figure 1
shows the extended family trees for eight sequence alterations, with
the individuals depicted being at least 30 years of age. As only the
two insertions--both leading to frame shift and premature protein termination (insertion 224_225insA causing Y75XfsX0, Fig. 1a, and 525_526insC leading to C176LfsX26, Fig. 1b)--were clearly patho
genic, we characterized the other germline alterations by in vitro
functional tests.

The splice donor mutation (145+1G>T) presents in a family with three sisters affected by breast or ovarian cancers (Fig. 1c) and disrupts the canonical GT dinucleotide. Comparison of the RAD51C splicing pattern in peripheral blood leukocytes from two heterozygous mutation carriers (Fig. 2a,b) revealed reduced expression of the normal RAD51C001 and increased expression of the nonfunctional RAD51C-008 transcript, whereas levels of the nonfunctional RAD51C-009 transcript were unchanged compared to controls (transcripts and

nomenclature according to the Ensembl genome browser). The latter
two transcripts used alternative 5 splice sites with intrinsic strengths of 17.4 and 16.1, respectively, as predicted by the HBond algorithm for 5 splice sites11 and confirmed by sequencing of the splice junctions in the different RT-PCR products (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To prove
that the normal RAD51C transcript was expressed solely from the
wild-type allele in the heterozygous leukocytes, we introduced exon 1, intron 1 and exon 2 of the RAD51C gene into a splicing construct12

Figure 1 RAD51C mutations in familial breast and ovarian cancer pedigrees. (a­h) Individuals with breast cancer (BC) are shown as filled circles, females with ovarian cancer (OC) as streaked circles; OP, surgery. Disease and age in years (y) at first diagnosis is given underneath the symbol, current age or age at death (+) above it. Other cancers diagnosed in the pedigrees are also shown (LC, lung cancer; KidC, kidney cancer; PanC, pancreatic cancer; CC, colon cancer; LAT, lower abdominal tumor; NHL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma; bil., bilateral). All affected individuals with breast or ovarian cancer not tested for germline mutations in RAD51C were deceased or refused testing. Carriers of RAD51C mutations are shown with their specific RAD51C mutation (as listed in Table 1), whereas individuals who tested negative for the mutation in the specific pedigree are depicted as wild-type (WT). In addition, LOH data (+ for loss of the WT allele, - for a retained WT allele) is shown for the individuals for whom formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of the tumor(s) could be analyzed.

(Fig. 2c). RT-PCR analysis after transfection of HeLa cells with the wild-type splicing reporter construct revealed usage of the exon 1 splice donor comparable to normal controls (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the RT-PCR analysis of the 145+1G>T splicing reporter showed complete inactivation of this mutant 5 splice site and increased transcript levels from the upstream proximal 5 splice site. Finally, the pathogenic nature of this 5 splice site mutation was demonstrated by the loss of the wild-type allele in the cancer tissue of the surviving subject with breast cancer in pedigree 1C (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
The second splice site mutation (904+5G>T) also affected an evolutionarily conserved position and was predicted to greatly decrease the complementarity between the U1 small nuclear RNA and the 5 splice site: the HBond score11 decreased from 15.8 to 10.1, a predictor of aberrant splicing. As cells carrying the germline mutation were not available (Fig. 1d), mRNA was isolated from paraffin-embedded tumor samples from two carriers of this mutation. As shown in Figure 2e, we were able to specifically amplify an RT-PCR product that lacked exon 6 in these carriers (Supplementary Fig. 1b) but not in control samples. For further confirmation, we introduced the RAD51C exon 6 with flanking 225- and 158-bp intronic sequences into a splicing reporter construct12 (Fig. 2f). Functional analysis in this heterologous context also demonstrated that the 904+5G>T mutation resulted in exclusion of exon 6, suggesting that the RAD51C exon 6 is recognized by exon definition (Fig. 2g). Finally, sequencing of DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded samples revealed that loss of the wild-type allele had occurred independently in the breast and the ovarian cancer tissues in two affected individuals from pedigree D (Supplementary Fig. 2c).
To initially screen whether the ten missense amino acid alterations change RAD51C protein function (Fig. 3), we used retroviral vectors13 to introduce the mutant human RAD51C proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3) into chicken DT40 cells in which the RAD51C ortholog had been disrupted14. Survival of cells expressing two missense alterations at highly conserved amino acids, G125V and L138F (Supplementary Fig. 4), was identical to the survival of control vector-transduced or untransduced Rad51c DT40 cells (Fig. 3a); the missense proteins therefore completely failed to complement the Rad51c mutant p henotype of these cells. In contrast, expression of the G3R, A126T, V169A and G264V missense RAD51C complementary DNAs corrected

the mitomycin C (MMC) hypersensitivity of Rad51c mutant DT40 cells to levels achieved by expression of the wild-type RAD51C cDNA (Fig. 3a,c). Expression of the four missense alterations D159N, G264S, T287A and R366Q only partially restored the MMC sensitivity of Rad51c DT40 cells compared to the wild-type cDNA (Fig. 3b,c) indicating hypomorphic mutations with reduced protein activity.
For further functional analysis of these missense mutations in human cells, we used the recently described RAD51C-mutated skin fibroblasts5. Assessing RAD51 foci15­17 in these cells after cross-linker exposure revealed that expression of the two mutations G125V and L138F did not restore normal RAD51 foci formation (Fig. 4), whereas RAD51C-mutated cells transduced with vectors expressing the remaining eight RAD51C missense variants were functionally indistinguishable from cells expressing the wild-type RAD51C cDNA.
In total, six germline alterations in RAD51C were classified as pathogenic: the two insertions, the two splice site mutations and the two missense alterations G125V and L138F. The corresponding pedigrees are shown in Figure 1a­f. One amino acid change (D159N) that was associated with reduced survival in DT40 cells, albeit leading to normal RAD51 foci formation when the missense protein was expressed in human RAD51C-mutated cells, was considered as an unclassified variant, unique in this pedigree affected by breast cancer only (Fig. 1g). Finally, despite intermediate complementation in DT40 cells, predictions by algorithms and amino acid conservation in RAD51C homologs, the R366Q variant (Fig. 1h) appeared unlikely to be pathogenic, as segregation was incomplete and there was no loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the tumor tested.
We tested whether the two recurrent missense mutations G264S and T287A, showing reduced survival of DT40 cells and normal RAD51 foci formation, were associated with cancer. Both G264S and T287A had no association with cancer in 1,100 affected individuals compared to 2,912 healthy controls. However, the G264S variant showed some evidence of association with malignancies in the subgroup of BC/OC families (Table 1; odds ratio, 3.44; confidence interval, 1.51­7.80; P = 5.32 × 10­3). Further assessment in larger studies is required to confirm this association.
The overall frequency of a pathogenic mutation in RAD51C among investigated families is 0.55% (6 of 1,100). However, when analyzing the six pedigrees with clearly pathogenic mutations (Fig. 1a­f), we

observed that all pedigrees presented with both breast and ovarian cancers--over different generations, in siblings or even as metachronous tumors. Thus, the six clearly pathogenic RAD51C mutations were all found within the 480 BC/OC pedigrees (1.3%).
In these six RAD51C-associated German BC/OC pedigrees, the mean age of onset at first diagnosis was 53 years (range 33­78) for breast cancer and 60 years (range 50­81) for ovarian cancer. This is higher than the mean ages of 40 and 46 years for German BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer, respectively, although lower than the mean age of 63 years for sporadic breast cancer. For ovarian cancer, the mean age of onset in individuals carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and the general population is 49, 58 and 68 years, respectively (R.K.S., A.M. and the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (GC-HBOC), unpublished data). No occurrence of male breast cancer was noted in these families. In addition, the segregation pattern in these six families is striking: none of the tested healthy females over 70 years of age inherited the mutations (the unaffected obligate carriers of the L138F mutation in Fig. 1f and of the frameshift mutation 224_5insA in Fig. 1a had surgery with removal of ovaries and uterus owing to a lower abdominal tumor at 43 and 40 years of age, respectively), and all of the affected first-degree relatives who developed malignancies and could be subjected to mutation analysis turned out to be carriers. This pattern of apparently complete segregation in the RAD51C families differs from that of families carrying ATM, CHEK2, BRIP1 and PALB2 mutations1. The occurrence of both breast and ovarian cancers, and the high frequencies, markedly resembles the clinical presentations of people carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations1,18. It is well established that the breast cancer histology in people with BRCA1 mutations shows an excess of ductal tumors with high mitotic count and negativity for hormone receptors and HER2/neu, compared to individuals with BRCA2 mutations or with sporadic breast cancers19,20.

Pathology reports were available from 11 cases of breast cancer associated with pedigrees shown in Figure 1a­f. Ten were classified as invasive and one as preinvasive ductal carcinomas. Only three of the ten invasive cancers presented with lymph node infiltration. Three cases were high-grade (G3) and eight cases were intermediate-grade (G2) tumors. Hormone receptor status was available for ten tumors: five were negative and five positive for the estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR). Of these, seven showed a concordant status: three were negative for both ER and PR, and four were positive for both ER and PR. Three tumors harbored a discordant receptor status: two were ER negative and PR positive, and one was ER positive and PR negative. All six breast cancers with HER2/neu status had a negative score. Of those, five were either ER or PR positive and one was negative for both receptors. These results indicate that RAD51C-associated breast cancer is distinct from BRCA1-associated breast cancer and might be associated with more favorable histopathological features like those of BRCA2-associated breast cancer. Pathological reports were available for seven RAD51C-associated ovarian cancers, six of which presented as invasive serous and one as invasive endometrioidal adenocarciomas. Three ovarian cancers were classified as high-grade (G3) and four as intermediate-grade (G2) tumors. Despite the fact that five of the seven ovarian cancers presented as pT3 tumors, only two had lymph node involvement, again indicating distinct features compared to BRCA1associated ovarian cancers, the majority of which are poorly differentiated invasive serous adenocarcinomas21.
Although RAD51C was identified in mammalian cells more than 10 years ago22, our findings on germline mutations in BC/OC families and the accompanying report on the identification of RAD51C as a new FA-like gene5 are, to our knowledge, the first clear links between mutations in RAD51C and human disease.

experiments with conditional knockouts in mice23, RAD51C functions as TP53-dependent tumor suppressor gene. The well-known association of genetic risk factors for breast and ovarian cancers with FA suggests that sequencing studies of FA genes and their protein interaction partners might reveal the existence of additional cancer susceptibility genes in the FA/BRCA pathway of homologous recombination repair24. In addition, the high penetrance of mutations impairing RAD51C function, and the causative link with the occurrence of gynecological cancers, justifies testing of other malignancies25 for alterations in RAD51C and its paralog. Ultimately, the identification of RAD51C as cancer susceptibility gene supports the `common disease, rare allele' hypothesis26, suggesting that affected females with a strong history for breast and ovarian cancer, but negative for mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and also RAD51C, should be screened using exomic sequencing25.

ONLINE METHODS Subjects, families and pedigrees. We recruited affected individuals from 1,100 German pedigrees with hereditary gynecological malignancies through a clinicogenetic counseling program at five centers (Cologne, Dresden, Düsseldorf, Munich and Ulm) from the GC-HBOC27,28. Of these, 620 pedigrees fulfilled the criterion that at least three affected females with breast cancer but no ovarian cancers were present (breast cancer pedigrees). In 480 pedigrees, at least one case of breast and one ovarian cancer had occurred (BC/OC pedigrees)28. We checked that all affected individuals in this study did not carry pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 using the PCR-based mutation-detection techniques dHPLC (or direct DNA sequencing, or both)27 and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification28. In total, 2,912 agematched control samples from healthy women were collected in NorthrhineWestphalia or provided by Kooperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg10,29,30. We completely sequenced 480 samples and screened 2,432 samples with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization­time of flight (MALDI-TOF; see below). Informed consent was obtained from all people participating in the study, and the experiments were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Cologne on behalf of the GC-HBOC.
Direct sequencing and dHPLC. For the rapid and reliable identification of RAD51C mutations, we used two different approaches. We detected mutations by dHPLC (WAVE system, Transgenomic) or by direct DNA sequencing on ABI3100 sequencers (Applied Biosystems). Primer pairs used for the amplification of the nine exons of the RAD51C gene are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Appropriate dHPLC conditions for running temperatures and buffer gradients were established for each individual exon. ABI BigDye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems) was used for cycle sequencing. We confirmed all mutations detected by DHPLC by direct DNA sequencing.
Sequencing of RAD51C transcripts. We amplified RAD51C transcripts from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RT-PCR with primers for RAD51C exon 1 and exon 3 and separated them on 6% polyacrylamide gels. RT-PCR products were extracted with elution buffer (0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS), reamplified with the RT-PCR primers using 2.5 U Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), gel-extracted (gel extraction kit, Qiagen) and directly sequenced.
MALDI-TOF and statistics. We used the homogeneous mass-extension process for producing primer extension products analyzed on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Sequenom MassArray system)31. Assays were designed with the SpectroDesigner software. Primer sequences are available upon request.
We calculated P values from standard 2 tests on the basis of allele counts, and odds ratios using standard methods. All calculations were done using R 2.91.
RNA extraction. We isolated total RNA from paraffin-embedded tumor samples using the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen), obtaining intact RNA molecules about 150 nucleotides long. We used PAXgene Blood RNA tubes for collection and stabilization of blood samples from subjects and isolated total RNA from blood samples with the PAXgene Blood RNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (PreAnalytiX, Qiagen).
Splicing analysis. We performed RT-PCR with total RNA extracted from blood samples derived from affected individuals. For analysis of the splicing pattern, before reverse transcription, 3 µg of total RNA was subjected to DNase I digestion with 10 U of DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We reverse-transcribed 3 µl of the treated RNA samples with the SuperScript III RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) using primer pairs specific for RAD51C exon 1 and exon 3, listed in Supplementary Table 1. To ensure a linear PCR amplification range allowing semiquantitative assessment of the spliced products, we performed PCR analysis with 28 cycles. PCR products were separated on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, stained with ethidium bromide, visualized and quantified with the Lumi-Imager F1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and directly sequenced after gel extraction.
Splicing reporter assays. For testing the 145+1G>T mutation, we amplified the subgenomic region spanning RAD51C exon 1, intron 1 and exon 2 from

control DNA by PCR with primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 using Expand High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). We cloned the PCR product into the pSVT7 expression vector32 and confirmed it by sequencing. We introduced the 5 splice site mutation by PCR mutagene sis using the RAD51C intron 1 forward and reverse mutagenesis primers with the QuickChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For functional analysis of the 904+5G>T mutation, we amplified the RAD51C exon 6, including the flanking intronic sequences, from genomic DNA by PCR with Expand High Fidelity DNA Polymerase and inserted it into the s plicing reporter construct as described previously12. We inserted the mutation by PCR mutagenesis using the RAD51C intron 6 forward and reverse mutagenesis primers. Cell culture and transfection experiments were performed as previously described32. We isolated total RNA 30 h after transfection using the GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma) and reversetranscribed 200 ng of the DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)­treated RNA with the SuperScript III RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen) and vector-specific primers.
Loss-of-heterozygosity analysis. We extracted DNA from sections of paraffin-embedded tumor tissues (QIAamp DNA FFPE tissue kit, Qiagen) after macrodissection to ensure the amount of tumor cells > 80% as visualized in a hematoxylin and eosin­stained control section. We specifically amplified RAD51C DNA fragments using appropriate primer pairs listed in Supplementary Table 1, directly sequenced them with ABI sequencer 3130XL and compared them to sequencing results of heterozygous germline DNA.
Complementation of Rad51c-deficient DT40 cells. Rad51c-deficient DT40 cells14 were purchased from the Riken BRC Cell Bank (Tsukuba). The control vectors S11IP, expressing an IRES-pac cassette, and S11RCIP, additionally expressing the wild-type RAD51C cDNA from the same expression cassette (Supplementary Fig. 4), were constructed as described5. We introduced the subject-derived missense mutations in the RAD51C open reading frame using a Quick Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of stable oncoretroviral cell lines and transduction of the nonadherent Rad51c DT40 cells with retroviral supernatant were performed as previously described13,33,34. Transduced cells were selected in the presence of puromycin (Gibco/Invitrogen) for 4­5 d, exposed for 3 d to increasing concentrations of MMC and then assayed by flow cytometry for survival of cells; we used propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) to discriminate live cells from dead cells as described34.
Protein expression of Rad51c missense mutants in Rad51c DT40 cells. We performed immunoblots with samples containing 50 µg of total protein on 4­12% NuPage Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-human RAD51C (1:1,000; ab55728 Abcam) or mouse monoclonal anti­-actin (1:5,000; A2228 Sigma-Aldrich). We used a secondary horseradish peroxidase­linked sheep anti-mouse IgG (RPN4201 GE Healthcare) at a dilution of 1:10,000 and detected it by the chemiluminescence technique using the ECL system (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
RAD51 foci immunofluorescence. For indirect immunofluorescence staining of RAD51 foci, we seeded cells onto coverslips (Nalgene NUNC) and incubated them the next day with 150 nM MMC (Medac) as described previously35. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (SigmaAldrich) for 15 min at 20­25 °C and permeabilized with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 for 5 min. After 30 min in blocking buffer (10% (wt/vol) BSA (PAA), 0.1% (vol/vol) NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich)), cells were incubated at 4 °C with rabbit anti-RAD51 (PC130, Calbiochem) at 1:200 dilution for 45 min. Cells were washed three times in TBS (Invitrogen) and then incubated with a 1:500-diluted Texas Red­conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch). After 45 min, cells were washed three times with TBS and the slides were mounted in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich). We viewed specimens with an inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss) and fluorescence imaging workstation and acquired images at 20­25 °C with a Plan-Apochromat ×63, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion lens using a digital camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss). RAD51 foci were counted independently in three different
