Background & Aims: Increasingly, studies of the relationship between common genetic variants and colorectal tumor risk are being proposed. To assess the evidence that any of these confers a risk, a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies was undertaken. Methods: Fifty studies of the effect of common alleles of 13 genes on risk were identified. To clarify the impact of individual polymorphisms on risk, pooled analyses were performed. Results: Of the 50 studies identified, significant associations were seen in 16, but only 3 were reported in more than one study. Pooling studies, significant associations were only seen for 3 of the polymorphisms: adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC)-I1307K (odds ratio [OR]  1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI ]: 1.21­2.07); Harvey ras-1 variable number tandem repeat polymorphism (HRAS1-VNTR; OR  2.50, 95% CI: 1.54 ­ 4.05); and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)Val/Val (OR  0.76, 95% CI: 0.62­ 0.92). For tumor protein 53 (TP53), N-acetyl transferase 1 (NAT1), NAT2, glutathione-S transferase Mu (GSTM1), glutathione-S transferase Theta (GSTT1), and glutathione-S transferase Pi (GSTP1) polymorphisms, the best estimates are sufficient to exclude a 1.7-fold increase in risk of colorectal cancer. Conclusions: APC-I1307K, HRAS1-VNTR, and MTHFR variants represent the strongest candidates for low penetrance susceptibility alleles identified to date. Although their genotypic risks are modest, their high frequency in the population implies that they may well have considerable impact on colorectal cancer incidence. Determining precise risk estimates associated with other variants and gene-gene and gene-environment interactions will be contingent on further studies with sample sizes larger than typically used to date.

mutations in genes such as adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), MLH1, and MSH2.4­6 First-degree relatives of colorectal cancer cases have a twofold increase in risk compared with the general population,7 most of which cannot be accounted for by APC, MSH2, or MLH1. Although part of the familial risk of colorectal cancer may be attributable to shared environment, there may be common, low penetrance genetic variants conferring susceptibility to colorectal cancer. Highly penetrant mutations in APC or the mismatch repair genes may cause a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers at young ages, but they are unlikely to be responsible for a high proportion of all cases. However, it is possible that low penetrance polymorphisms could do so.7 It is difficult or impossible to identify such gene polymorphisms by linkage analysis, because the number of affected relative pairs required will be prohibitively large.8 The commonest method for identifying common low penetrance alleles is through association studies. These are based on comparing the frequency of polymorphic genotypes in cases and controls. Alleles positively associated with the disease are analogous to risk factors in epidemiology and may be causally related to disease risk or in linkage disequilibrium with disease-causing variants (i.e., certain haplotype combinations of alleles at different loci occur more frequently than would be expected from random association).
There are a number of different methods of analyzing the risk associated with a specific variant.9 For simple biallelic polymorphisms, the odds ratio (OR) of colorectal cancer can be derived by comparing allele frequencies in cases and controls. This approach is, however, less

After lung and breast cancer, colorectal cancer is the most common cause of death from malignant disease in Western countries. In England and Wales, there are approximately 30,000 new cases each year resulting in 17,000 deaths.1,2 Worldwide, it has been estimated there are at least half a million new cases of colorectal cancer each year.3 Although about 10% of colorectal cancer cases have some family history of the disease, only 2% to 6% can be ascribed to the rare, highly penetrant

powerful than a comparison of frequencies of the 3 genotypes among cases and controls using homozygosity of the "wild type allele" as the reference group. Where homozygotes are rare, it is common to combine the heterozygotes and homozygotes together, but this is only appropriate if a dominant model can be presumed. Similarly, combining heterozygotes with wild-type homozygotes is only appropriate if alleles act recessively. For multi-allelic loci, the frequency of certain genotypes can be low and the chi-squared statistics produced from analyses of such tables do not conform well to the asymptotic distribution. It is therefore common to group certain alleles together and analyze as a bi-allelic polymorphism. These groups are ideally defined on the basis of expressed phenotypes.
Most colorectal cancers develop from normal epithelium through sequentially worsening degrees of adenomatous dysplasia.10 The molecular basis for this sequence is reasonably well established, requiring a series of at least 5 mutations.10,11 Within this pathway, there are a number of different mechanisms by which low penetrance polymorphisms could either contribute directly to tumorigenesis or facilitate the acquisition of mutations, so affecting progression of normal colonic epithelium to carcinoma. The candidate genes that have been evaluated to date can be broadly delineated into those coding for: carcinogen metabolism enzymes, methylation enzymes, DNA repair proteins, microenvironmental modifiers, oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and others. Table 1 details the candidate gene polymorphisms that have been reviewed. For clarity, the position and standard nomenclature of each polymorphism is given.
Carcinogen Metabolism Genes
Colonic crypt cells express several of the important xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. Hence, cancer susceptibility may result from differences in the expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of aromatic and heterocyclic amines present in food.
The first and obligatory step in the activation of arylamines is N-hydroxylation by phase-I enzymes that include cytochrome P450A1 (CYP1A1). CYP1A1 is induced by, and acts on, carcinogens found in tobacco smoke.12,13
The N-acetyl transferases, NAT1 and NAT2, are phase-II metabolizing enzymes detoxifying arylamines, some of which are derived from cooked meat. The action of NATs on these carcinogens can generate electrophilic ions capable of inducing DNA point mutations. The capacity to perform N-acetylation of arylamine chemicals is subject to extensive genetic variation. NAT2 is respon-

sible for inherited interindividual differences in the ability to acetylate certain drugs.12,14 Slow acetylators are homozygous for low-activity alleles, and fast acetylators carry one or more high activity alleles. Variation in NAT1 and NAT2 may influence the local presentation of carcinogens such as arylamines found in cooked meat, to crypt cells. Studies in rats provide some support for this hypothesis, with carcinogen-induced aberrant intestinal crypt formation being highest in rapid acetylators.15
The glutathione-S transferases are a family of phase-II enzymes responsible for the detoxification of mutagenic electrophiles including polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Homozygotes for null alleles (deletion) of glutathione-S transferase Mu (GSTM1) and glutathione-S transferase Theta (GSTT1) have absent activity of the respective enzyme. DNA adduct formation and rates of somatic mutation have been reported to be increased in carriers of null alleles.12,16
Other metabolic genes that have been investigated as risk factors for colorectal cancer include microsomal epoxide hydroxylase (mEPHX),17 involved in the detoxification of carcinogenic epoxides and steroidogenesis.18 Two polymorphisms appear to affect enzyme activity.18
Methylation Genes
Global and gene-specific anomalies of DNA methylation contribute to loss of proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor expression. In colorectal cancer, this occurs during progression of adenomas to carcinomas.19,20 There is some evidence that DNA methylation can be influenced by manipulating the availability of methyl group donors, such as folate.21 Folate levels are influenced by 2 enzymes: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzing the conversion of 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (required for purine and thymidine synthesis), to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (methyl-THF), the primary circulatory form of folate necessary for methionine synthesis; and methionine synthetase (MTR) catalyzing transfer of a methyl group from methyl-THF to homocysteine. The Ala667Val polymorphism of MTHFR codes for an enzyme with reduced activity-- homozygotes have about 30% of the normal enzyme activity and decreased levels of methyl-THF.22 Although decreased levels of methyl-THF may adversely affect DNA methylation contributing to carcinogenesis, depletion of methylene-tetrahydrofolate interferes with thymidylate biosynthesis leading to deoxynucleotide pool imbalances. An accumulation of deoxyuridylate DNA and subsequent removal of this abnormal base may "liabilize" DNA to strand breaks.

The substitutions at positions 191, 341, 590, and 857 are diagnostic for defective NAT2 function and hence, slow acetylator phenotype.

Microenvironmental Modifiers
Mutation of PLA2G2A, the secretory phospholipase A2 gene, dramatically increases the number of intestinal polyps that develop in the multiple intestinal neoplasia mouse, a murine model for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).23 PLA2G2A probably exerts its action by altering the cellular microenvironment within

the intestinal crypt,24,25 possibly through prostaglandin synthesis.
It is well established that the colonic microenvironment is modified by bile acid excretion.26 Apolipoprotein-E (APO-E) occupies a pivotal role in lipoprotein metabolism as one of the ligands involved in the receptor-mediated uptake of low-density lipoprotein and chy-

lomicron remnants.27 Three common isoforms of APO-E exist--E2, E3, and E4.26 Chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein clearance is faster and fecal bile acid output lower in individuals with the APO-E4 allele.27
Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors
The HRAS proto-oncogene VNTR minisatellite is located 1 kilobase downstream of H-ras1 and is composed of 30 to 100 units of a 28­base pair consensus sequence. Over 30 alleles of the H-ras-VNTR have been described.28 The 4 most common represent over 90% of alleles and serve as progenitors for rare alleles.28 Rare alleles have been proposed as risk factors for a variety of cancers.28 The basis of a relationship is, however, unclear. The Harvey ras-1 variable number tandem repeat polymorphism (HRAS1-VNTR) has been shown to modulate the expression of nearby genes by interacting with transcriptional regulatory elements, such as the rel/NF-B family of regulatory factors. Alternatively, the association may result from linkage disequilibrium.28
Truncating APC mutations are responsible for FAP, and defective mismatch repair genes cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer.5,6 Polymorphisms in these genes have been identified, but because they are common or they are not predicted to alter protein structure, they have generally been considered to have little pathogenic potential. This may not be the case. Laken et al.29 first drew attention to a possible relationship between the I1307K APC variant and colorectal cancer risk in the Ashkenazi population. I1307K was present in 6% of controls, compared with 10% in colorectal cancer patients. The mutation leads to creation of an A8 tract instead of the normal A3TA4 , possibly increasing the rate of somatic mutation,29 so indirectly conferring susceptibility. Other APC variants that have been proposed as colorectal tumor risk factors include E1317Q.
Somatic mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 are common as a mid-/late-stage event in colorectal cancer.11 Overexpression of tumor protein 53 (TP53) protein induced by genotoxic damage results in G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of repair or apoptosis. Mutations in TP53 that cause the Li-Fraumeni syndrome lead to decreased TP53 activity resulting in defective repair or apoptosis.30 In addition to these types of mutations, a number of polymorphisms of TP53 are recognized, although their functional significance is unknown.
Although polymorphism in any DNA repair gene is theoretically a potential risk factor for colorectal tumors, components of the mismatch repair machinery are the prime candidates. Many polymorphisms exist in MSH2, MLH1, and MSH6 (http://www.nfdht.nl/database), al-

though in most cases, functional effects are almost entirely unknown and/or alleles are rare.
Other Genes
The cytokine tumor necrosis factors beta (TNF) and alpha (TNF) produced by activated macrophages have cytostatic and cytotoxic antitumor activity.31,32 Polymorphic variation in TNF genes has been linked to level of TNF expression and prognosis in gastric and lung cancer.33
In this systematic review, every effort has been made to ascertain all published studies that have examined the possible effects of polymorphic variation in the genes discussed on the risk of colorectal neoplasia in the context of an epidemiologic study. Although some genes have only been examined once, most have been evaluated as risk factors in several studies, often with discordant findings. Many of the studies are based on small sample sizes; therefore, to derive a more precise estimate of the risk associated with individual polymorphisms, results have been combined wherever possible in a meta-analysis. The underlying basis of meta-analysis is not directly to combine results from studies, but to obtain a relative measure of the observed effect supporting or rejecting a specific hypothesis. An advantage of this statistical procedure is the amalgamation of data collected and analyzed by different methods. The implications of the findings for future research on predisposition to colorectal neoplasia are discussed.
Methods
Literature Search
Published studies that had examined the relationship between polymorphisms and risk of colorectal neoplasia were identified using the electronic database MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC) for the years 1983­ 1999 inclusive, using the search terms "colorectal_neoplasms" and "polymorphism(s)." A search was also made on individual candidate genes. Additional articles were ascertained through references cited in these publications. Care was taken to include only primary data or data that superseded earlier work. Characteristics of the studies were extracted from published articles and summarized in a consistent manner to aid comparison.
Statistical Analysis
ORs associated with individual polymorphisms were extracted from published reports or were computed from crude data. Pooled estimates of ORs were obtained using standard calculating the weighted-average of the logarithm of ORs.34 Studies were analyzed jointly using both a fixed-effects and a random-effects model--if significant heterogeneity between

286 HOULSTON AND TOMLINSON

GASTROENTEROLOGY Vol. 121, No. 2

studies was present.35 A random-effects model assumes that the studies in question are a random sample of a hypothetical population of studies taking into account within- and between-study variability. In cases in which a polymorphism is associated with distinctive phenotype, the principal analysis combined genotypes by phenotypic class; otherwise, ORs were computed for each genotype. Specific analyses considering confounding factors were not possible because the raw data were not available.
To ascertain the presence of publication bias, ORs were plotted in order according to the variance of the logOR estimate. Estimates from small studies that have less precision in estimating the underlying OR will scatter widely at the base of the graph, with a narrowing among larger studies. In the absence of publication bias, the plot resembles a symmetrical inverted funnel. Conversely, if there is bias, the funnel plot will be asymmetrical. To reduce the possibility of error in assessing publication by simple visual examination, funnel asymmetry was formally evaluated using the Egger et al.36 regression asymmetry test. This test detects asymmetry by determining whether the intercept deviates significantly from zero in a regression of the standardized effect estimates against their precision. Failure of the standardized effect confidence interval (CI) to include zero indicates asymmetry and provides evidence of publication bias. Statistical manipulations were undertaken using the statistical program STATA version 6.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station TX) utilizing the META37 and METABIAS38 modules.
In any large, randomly mating population, in which there is no migration, or selection against a particular genotype and the mutation rate remains constant, the proportions of the various genotypes will remain unchanged from one generation to another. To test for population stratification, the distribution of genotypes in controls was tested for a departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium by means of the chi-squared test.
The power of each study was computed as the probability of detecting an association between genotypes and colorectal cancer at the 0.05 level of significance, assuming a genotypic risk of 2 or 0.5. These estimates were performed on the basis of the method published by Fleiss et al.,39 using the statistical program POWER (Epicenter Software, Pasadena, CA; http:// icarus2.hsc.usc.edu/epicenter/).
Results
Individual Studies
Fifty studies were identified from the literature and are summarized in Table 2. All were essentially of similar design, although a variety of cases and controls have been analyzed. Fewer than 30% of the studies had 80% or greater power to demonstrate a twofold difference in allele frequency between cases and controls. The ORs of colorectal disease associated with the different polymorphisms in individual studies are given in Table

3 along with their corresponding 95% CIs. Where ORs were not reported, they have been derived from the raw data. Polymorphisms in 13 genes have been evaluated as potential colorectal cancer risk factors. Many of the results from different studies are discordant.
Carcinogen Metabolism Genes
Variation in CYP1A1 defined by the Ile462Val and T6325C polymorphisms and colorectal cancer has only been evaluated in one small study of in situ cancer to date.50 The risk of colorectal cancer was increased 7.9-fold in Ile462Val carriers, but confidence limits were wide (1.4 ­ 44.4), reflecting the size of the study. No association between colorectal cancer risk and the T6325C polymorphism was observed.
NAT2 has been as investigated as a colorectal tumor risk factor in 15 studies.40,41,45,51,52,55,58,59,62,67,68,72,76,77,90 In 4 of the studies, NAT2 status was assigned on the basis of acetylator phenotype rather than genotype. The risk of colorectal cancer associated with rapid acetylator status was increased in 9 of the 15 studies, but was only statistically significant in the 3 small studies based on phenotyping.40,41,62 The relationship between NAT2 and colorectal adenoma risk has been examined in 2 studies,58,62 but neither showed a significant association.
Six studies have examined the relationship between specific allelic variants of NAT1 and risk of colorectal neoplasia.55,59,70,72,81,91 Bell et al.55 reported that possession of the NAT1*10 allele was associated with a 1.92fold increase in risk of colorectal cancer, but this was not confirmed in the studies reported by Chen et al.72 and Yoshioka et al.91 Probst-Hensch et al.59 also found no relationship between the NAT1*10 allele and risk of colorectal adenomas. Lin et al.81 and Hubbart et al.70 examined the relationship between other NAT1 alleles and risk of colorectal cancer. Neither found support for an association between NAT1 genotype defined by NAT1*14/15 alleles and risk of colorectal cancer.
Twelve studies have examined the relationship between GSTM1 status and colorectal cancer risk,46,48,56,60,61,69,76,78,83­ 85,92 and one study examined colorectal adenoma risk.57 Five studies showed that the GSTM1-deletion conferred an increase in colorectal cancer risk,46,48,61,84,92 but this was only significant in 2 studies.48,92 The study reported by Zhong et al.48 found that the risk of colorectal cancer associated with GSTM1deletion was primarily associated with proximal disease in a subgroup analysis, a finding not confirmed by other studies.56,60,61,69,76 The relationship between GSTM1 status and adenoma risk was examined by Lin et al.57; no relationship was seen.

Conflicting findings have also been reported in studies of the relationship between GSTT1 status and colorectal cancer risk. Two studies showed a significant association between deficiency and risk,60,83 but either no relationship was seen or, in 5 other studies, the opposite was seen.56,61,69,84,85 The study by Zhang et al.,83 which showed the largest risk, may be methodologically flawed, as GSTT1 status was determined by analysis of colonic tissue--any contamination by tumor tissue showing allelic loss at GSTT1 would invalidate the findings.
Three studies have investigated glutathione-S transferase Pi (GSTP1) status defined by the Ile105Val and Ala114Val polymorphisms as risk factors for colorectal cancer.73,84,91 None has shown that either polymorphism confers an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Two polymorphisms of mEPHX have been examined in one study.18 mEPHXTyr113His homozygosity was associated with a significant increase in risk of colorectal cancer. The mEPHXHis139Arg polymorphism was not associated with risk of cancer.18 There was, however, evidence of population stratification in the study as the distribution of Tyr113His genotypes shows a departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Methylation Genes
Four studies have examined the relationship between the C677T MTHFR polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk.64,66,71,88,90 All showed an inverse relationship between MTHFRVal/Val genotype and colorectal cancer risk, although the relationship was only statistically significant in the study reported by Ma et al.66 The study reported by Ma et al.8 shows borderline departure from

Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, suggesting the possibility of population stratification. The polymorphism has also been evaluated as a risk factor for colorectal adenomas in one study.71 No difference in the frequency of homozygosity was seen between 257 incident polyp cases and 713 controls in the study reported by Chen et al.71 If an inverse relationship between MTHFRAla/Val genotype and colorectal cancer risk exists, the fact that no relationship was seen with adenomas raises the possibility that its impact is only on late stage tumorigenesis. The 2 studies of the Asp/Gly polymorphism of methionine synthetase have shown no significant association with risk of colorectal cancers or adenomas.71,89
Oncogene and Tumor-Suppressor Genes
Five studies have examined the risk of colorectal cancer associated with rare alleles of the HRAS1VNTR.28,42­44,75 Four of the studies were based on Southern blot analysis,28,42­44 whereas the most recently reported by Gosse-Brun et al.75 was polymerase chain reaction­ based. The OR of colorectal cancer was greater than unity in all of studies, but only statistically significant in 2.44,75
Since the original observation of a relationship between the APC I1307K and colorectal cancer risk made by Laken et al.,29 3 studies have reported a positive relationship between this variant and risk of colorectal neoplasia.74,82,87 Frayling et al.74 have also reported that the E1317Q mutation also confers an increased risk of colorectal tumor. TP53 Arg72Pro, intron-6, and intron-3 polymorphisms have been evaluated in 2 studies--neither found any relationship.49,54

Polymorphic variation in only one mismatch repair gene, MLH1, has been examined to date.53 No association was seen.
Other Genes
The 238G 3 A TNF- polymorphism has been shown in one study to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.80 There was no association with the 308G 3 A TNF- polymorphism.
Meta-analysis
For the meta-analysis, data from studies of 11 of the genes were suitable for pooling. The study by Zhang et al.83 was omitted from the meta-analysis of GSTM1 and GSTT1, as in this study colonic tissue was assayed. Table 4 details the studies that were combined for each of the polymorphic variants and the results of each analysis in relation to risk of colorectal cancer. In the

absence of heterogeneity between studies, pooled estimates of risk were based on the fixed-effects model. There were statistically significant associations between colorectal cancer risk and 3 of the polymorphic variants: APC-I1307K (OR  1.58, 95% CI: 1.21­2.07); HRAS1-VNTR rare alleles, and MTHFRVal/Val (OR  0.76, 95% CI: 0.62­ 0.92). There was no obvious evidence from visual diagnostic appraisal or formal analysis of findings for publication bias in these studies. The risk of colorectal cancer associated with rare alleles of the HRAS1-VNTR remained increased if the analysis was restricted to the 4 studies based on Southern analysis.28,42­ 44
In the pooled analysis, NAT2 rapid acetylator status determined by phenotyping was associated with an increased risk; however, no relationship was seen in the studies based on genotyping. Hence in the combined

analysis, there was no significant evidence for an association. Although there was no statistical evidence for publication bias, this could not be excluded. Combining the 2 studies that examined NAT2 status and risk of colorectal adenomas,58,62 there was no evidence for a relationship (OR  1.08; 95% CI: 0.85­1.39). A minority of studies estimated the risk of colorectal cancer associated with NAT2-rapid acetylator status by site, distinguishing between colon and rectal cancers.68,76,78 Using these studies, the risks of colon and rectal cancers were 1.09 (0.95­1.25; P  0.24) and 1.05 (0.70 ­1.58; P  0.82), respectively.
There was no evidence from the meta-analysis to indicate that either GSTM1 or GSTT1 deficiency is significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. It has, however, been proposed that any association between GSTM1 deficiency and colorectal cancer might be confined to proximal disease.48 There was little evidence from a pooled analysis to support this notion. The cancer risk associated with proximal disease was

1.14 (95% CI: 0.85­1.57, P  0.38), and that with distal disease was 1.14 (95% CI: 0.96 ­1.29, P  0.14). Similarly, there was no evidence to support the postulate that GSTT1 deficiency might confer significant susceptibility to proximal disease, the combined OR being 1.10 (95% CI: 0.72­1.67, P  0.44).
Interaction Between Polymorphisms
The possibilities of gene-gene interactions impacting on colorectal cancer risk have been explored in some of the studies of enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism. A possible gene-gene interaction between NAT1-rapid (defined by the NAT1*10 allele) and NAT2-rapid acetylator status was reported by Bell et al.55 The interaction was associated with a 2.2-fold elevated risk of colorectal cancer, but this was nonsignificant (95% CI: 0.8 ­ 6.1). No support for this notion was seen in the study reported by Chen et al.72 (OR  0.78, CI: 0.48 ­1.27), or in the study of colorectal adenoma risk reported by Probst-Hensch et al.59 (OR  1.11,

296 HOULSTON AND TOMLINSON

95% CI: 0.79 ­1.56). Similarly, no interaction between NAT1 status, defined by NAT1*14 and NAT1*15 alleles, and NAT2-rapid acetylator status was found by Hubbard et al.70 A possible interaction between GSTM1 and GSTT1 was evaluated in 3 studies reported by Gertig et al.,69 Abdel-Rahman et al.,85 and Deakin et al.60 No interaction between the 2 loci was seen in these studies. Paradoxically, an interaction between NAT2slow acetylator and GSTT1-null status was reported by Welfare et al.84 (OR  2.33, 95% CI: 1.1­5.0).
Polymorphism-Environment Interaction
Dietary folate, methionine, and alcohol intake have been associated in some, but not all, epidemiologic studies with risk of colorectal neoplasia.93,94 How these dietary factors might impact on colorectal cancer risk is not well established, but one unifying mechanism is that they act in concert through DNA methylation. Although modest depletion of dietary folate may not be sufficient to cause hypomethylation in vivo, high levels of alcohol might reduce levels of S-adenosyl methionine sufficient to impact on patterns of DNA methylation. There is some support for this from the studies of MTHFRAsp/Val, in which the inverse relationship between homozygosity and cancer risk was not seen in individuals with diets deficient in methionine or rich in alcohol.64,66,88 The adverse effect of alcohol on risk was greater in homozygotes and the protective effect of genotype diminished by folate deficiency. No significant interaction between genotype and folate, methionine, or alcohol intake on polyp formation was, however, seen,71 suggesting any effect on cancer risk is post-adenoma.
Diets high in animal fat and red meat have been proposed to increase the risk of colorectal neoplasia.95,96 NAT is of particular interest in respect to metabolism of polycyclic amines derived from cooked meats. Positive associations between red meat intake, NAT2 acetylator status, and colorectal neoplasia have been reported in the studies by Lang et al.,40 Chen et al.,72 Probst-Hensch et al.,58 Roberts-Thomson et al.,62 and Welfare et al.68 Other lifestyle factors suggested as risk factors for colorectal neoplasia include cigarette smoking, although the evidence is equivocal.97­99 Higher levels of DNA damage have been observed in individuals with GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes in heavy smokers compared with nonsmokers. There is, however, no evidence to date from the studies of Katoh et al.,61 Gertig et al.,69 or Slattery et al.76 to support an interaction between GSTM1 and GSTT1 and smoking on colorectal cancer risk. Welfare et al.68 purported that there is an interaction between NAT2-status and smoking, but this was not supported by Slattery et al.76

Discussion
Research into genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer has, until recently, largely focused on the identification of genes causing dominantly inherited diseases such as FAP, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, and, to a lesser extent, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and juvenile polyposis. Mutations in the genes in their classical guise (resulting in a truncated protein) are associated with a significant risk of colorectal cancer, but carriers in the general population are rare; hence, the overall impact of such mutations on cancer incidence will be small. As opportunities to identify further high penetrance genes diminish, increasing attention is being paid to the possibility that common low penetrance genes might in part determine susceptibility to colorectal cancer.
Substantial research has been performed evaluating the polymorphisms in a number of genes as low penetrance colorectal tumor susceptibility alleles. Has this all been worthwhile? There is no clear evidence that any is strongly associated with risk of colorectal cancer or adenomas. Of the 24 variants examined to date, few have been reported as statistically significant in more than one study-- defined by a P value of 0.05. Given the issue of multiple testing in many reports, it is clearly advantageous when interpreting any purported association to stipulate low P values, or to replicate findings in independent samples, or ideally both. The issue of if it is appropriate to correct for multiple testing and on what basis this should be undertaken is a thorny issue arousing considerable debate. Boehringer et al.100 have argued that a correction should be based on the number of polymorphisms analyzed in any one gene rather than on the total number of polymorphisms analyzed if more than one gene is evaluated.
In some studies, the failure to demonstrate a relationship may in part be a consequence of lack of power. It is unlikely that any common predisposition allele will confer much more than a twofold difference in the risk of colorectal tumors. Fewer than 40% of studies had 80% power to show a twofold difference in risk at the 0.05 significance level. To overcome this lack of power, a meta-analysis was undertaken by pooling the data from published studies. There are, however, caveats to this statistical procedure. In any systematic review, publication bias is clearly of great concern. The most common scenario is that negative findings may go unreported. We cannot exclude this possibility for the 3 polymorphisms that seem to confer a risk of colorectal cancer (HRAS1VNTR, MTHFRAla/Val, and APCI1307K). Furthermore, many studies do not describe the ethnicity of cases or

controls, and it is assumed that each polymorphism is functional with respect to risk in each study population. This is likely to be the case with MTHFR and presumably also, at least in part, with APCI1307K. If, however, the polymorphism is a neutral marker for another variant, the assumption may well not apply, because linkage disequilibrium can be population-dependent. The studies of the risks associated with APCI1307K are unique in this respect, having been performed exclusively in the Ashkenazi population. Another potential issue in combining data relates to designation of individual polymorphisms. In some genes, multiple polymorphisms can be detected by the same assay. This is clearly a problem with microsatellite or minisatellite polymorphisms, such as the HRAS1-VNTR, in which assigning alleles can be problematic. The choice of the cutoff between rare and common alleles is crucial, and allele definition may be different between studies. The low resolution of the Southern blot method used in early studies of the HRAS1-VNTR may have failed to distinguish some rare alleles.101 This, coupled with post hoc analysis of data in studies, suggests that the relationship between rare alleles and risk of colorectal cancer should be revisited.
Ideally, quality scoring of studies should be used to determine which studies are included in any meta-analysis.102 This was not undertaken because existing scales have not been validated and it is also unclear how they could readily be applied to the published studies of polymorphisms and colorectal tumor risk.103
If genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer is mediated through polymorphic variation, it is probable that combinations of genotypes should be more discriminating as risk factors than a single locus genotype, especially if a multiplicative model of interaction operates. Some investigators have performed subgroup analyses; however, in many cases the data were "mined" to detect a significant finding.
An important lesson from current studies is that greater attention should be paid to design in future studies. It has been argued that in association studies based on genotyping, it is unnecessary to take into account factors such as age or concomitant disease, because they do not influence genotype.104 The age-structure of cases and controls is, however, a source of potential bias, albeit a minor one, because genotypes may display age-dependency. For example, the population frequencies of APO-E genotypes show age-dependency.105 Furthermore, age is relevant to determining the probable exposure to carcinogens. A difference in the ages between cases and controls is therefore a potential source of bias. Considering the issues of concomitant disease, a number of the

studies were based on a comparison of cases and noncolon cancer disease controls. The use of healthy population controls is preferable, because it is conceivable that the polymorphism might confer susceptibility to noncancer diseases.
The issue of population stratification in case-control studies and resulting false positive results is also of great concern. If population subdivisions exist, it will be possible to find associations between disease and arbitrary markers that are unlinked to causative loci. These associations occur because of population subdivision and nonrandom mating, leading to variation in the marker frequency within the population as a result of founder effects and/or genetic drift. The severity of spurious association becomes an increasing problem with increasing study size. To avoid the problem of such spurious associations, it is essential that any potential confounding effect of population stratification be allowed for in the design and analysis of a study. This requires the identification of subpopulations in terms of factors that can influence both disease and marker allele frequencies. Provided cases and controls are well-matched, differences in the frequency of genotypes will only be seen at predisposition loci. Hence, stratification can be detected by typing a series of unlinked markers chosen from a panel known to exhibit differences in allele frequency between populations.106 The appropriate Bonferroni correction would be required to assess the statistical significance of any putative association. One method of circumventing the problem of occult population stratification is to use family-based controls. The most common approach is the transmission disequilibrium test, which assesses the evidence for preferential transmission of one allele over the other from heterozygous parents.107 To obviate the requirement for parental genotypes, allied statistics based on the use of sibling genotypes have been devised.108,109
Despite these concerns, it is possible to draw a number of conclusions from the evidence. The APC-I1307K, HRAS1-VNTR rare alleles, and MTHFRAla/Val variants seem to represent the strongest candidates for low penetrance susceptibility alleles of the polymorphisms evaluated to date. Although the genotypic risks associated with these variants are modest, because they are not uncommon, they will have considerable impact on the overall burden of colorectal cancer. For example, APCI1307K may account for up to 6% of all Ashkenazi Jewish colorectal cancer. For polymorphisms of NAT1, NAT2, GSTM1, and GSTT1, the best estimate of risk obtained from the meta-analysis is sufficient to exclude a colorectal cancer risk greater than 1.7-fold. For the remainder--GSTP1, CYP1A1, mEPHX, MTR, and secre-

tory phospholipase A2 (PLAG2A)--the estimates of risk are too imprecise and, although there is no good evidence to implicate them to date, moderate increases in risk of colorectal cancer cannot be excluded. To derive precise estimates of the risks associated with variants of these genes and to investigate gene-gene and gene-environment interactions will require much larger sample sizes than have been used in published studies.
The notion that inter-individual differences in colorectal cancer risk may in part be attributable to polymorphic variation is an attractive hypothesis. Alleles of other genes such as the DNA repair genes or other metabolic enzymes represent candidates for future studies. At present, association studies in colorectal cancer are restricted to evaluating polymorphisms in a small number of candidate genes. In the medium term, polymorphisms for all genes will be identified. This, and the introduction of reliable, high-density oligonucleotide arrays (or alternative methods) will allow allelic association studies to be conducted on a genome-wide basis. The detection of low penetrance colorectal cancer susceptibility genes will then only be restricted by the availability of large cohorts of well-characterized cases and controls. The polymorphism studies that have been conducted to date have important lessons for the design and execution of future studies. It is clear that in addition to conducting studies using sample sizes commensurate with the detection of low penetrance polymorphisms, attention should be paid to adequate matching of cases and controls to avoid problems of population stratification and other sources of potential bias.
