Summary
DNA from 61 unrelated patients with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was examined for mutations in three genes @Pi, SRP79, and DP2.5) located within a 166 kb region deleted in two of the patients. The intron-exon boundary sequences were defined for each of these genes, and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons from DP2.5 identified four mutations specific to APC patients. Each of two aberrant alleles contained a base substitution changing an amino acid to a stop codon in the predicted peptide; the other mutations were small deletions leading to frameshifts. Analysts of DNA from parents of one of these patients showed that his 2 bp deletion is a new mutation; furthermore, the mutation was transmitted to two of his children. These data have established that DP2.5 is the APC gene.
Introduction
Familial adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is adominantly inherited autosomal disorder characterized by an early onset of multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and a high likelihood of colon carcinoma. As the gene responsible for familial APC also may play a key role in the development of sporadic colon cancer, identification of the APC gene would provide a valuable tool for examination of early

events in the progression of normal colonic epithelium to adenoma and to carcinoma.
Pulsed-field gel analysis of the APC region in DNA from 40 patients revealed deletions in two patients (see Joslyn et al., 1991 [this issue]). The smaller deletion, of approximately 100 kb, is nested within the second, 260 kb deletion. Three candidate genes that map into the smallerdeletion have been identified (Figure 1). To determine which of them, if any, is responsible for the inherited disease, mutations specific to APC patients must be demonstrated.
Cytogenetically visible deletions at the locus of the APC gene, in addition to the two smaller deletions, have been observed in affected individuals (Herrera et al., 1986; Rivera et al., 1990). If the deletions in these patients are causing the disease by removing all or part of a gene, one would expect that single-base substitutions that inactivate the gene also might be able to cause APC. Therefore, we undertook a search for inactivating point mutations in the three genes within the doubly deleted region, using singlestrand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis (Orita et al., 1989a, 1989b). SSCP has proven useful in the analysis of other disease-causing mutations, such as those in neurofibromatosis type 1 and cystic fibrosis, where DNA sequence variation has been characterized successfully at the level of single-base substitutions (Cawthon et al., 1990; Dean et al., 1990). Examination of 12 of the 17 exons of MCC by this method has so far failed to reveal any variants unique to APC patients (J. G., unpublished data).
Identification of intron-exon boundaries provided intronic sequence flanking each of the exons of the three new candidate genes, and specific oligonucleotides primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic exon sequences from APC patients and controls. SSCP conformers unique to APC patients were identified; sequencing revealed several distinct stop codons and frameshift mutations in the DP2.5 gene, one of which was a new mutation.
Results
Intron-Exon Boundaries Figure 1 provides a map of the region deleted in patients 3214 and 3824, indicating the relative locations of the restriction sites and genes ascertained from within the deletions. To obtain DNA sequence adjacent to the exons of the genes DPl, DP2.5, and SRP19, sequencing substrate was obtained by inverse PCR amplification of DNAs from two YACs, 310D8 and 1831-112, that span the deletions (Joslyn et al., 1991). Ligation at low concentration cyclized the restriction enzyme-digested YAC DNAs. Oligonucleotides with sequencing tails, designed in inverse orientation at intervals along the cDNAs, primed PCR amplification from the cyclized templates. Comparison of these DNA sequences with the cDNA sequences (see Joslyn et al., 1991) placed exon boundaries at the divergence points. SRPl9 and LIP1 were each shown to have five exons

Figure 1. Restriction Map of the Central 500 kb of the 1200 kb Not1 Fragment Spanning the APC Region
Genomic DNA is shown in black with restriction sites marked vertically. The two deletion chromosomes identified by Joslyn et al. (1991) are shown as stippled lines; clones mapping in the deleted regions are shown below. Positions and orientations of three genes in the doubly deleted region, as well as the 3' end of MCC, are shown above the map.

(G. J. and A. T., unpublished data [D/V and SRP79, respectively]). DP2.5 consisted of 15 exons.
The sequences of the oligonucleotides synthesized to provide PCR amplification primers for the exons of each of these genes are listed in Table 1. With the exception of exons 1, 3,4, 9, and 15 of DP2.5 (see below), the primer sequences were located in intron sequences flanking the exons. The 5' primer of exon 1 is complementary to the cDNA sequence, but extends just into the 5'Kozak context sequence for the initiator methionine, allowing a survey of the translated sequences. The 5' primer of exon 3 is actually in the 5'coding sequences of this exon, as three separate intronic primers simply would not amplify. The 5' primer of exon 4 just overlaps the 5' end of this exon, and we thus fail to survey the 19 most 5' bases of this exon. For exon 9, two overlapping primer sets were used, such that each had one end within the exon. For exon 15, the large 3' exon of DP2.5, overlapping primer pairs were placed along the length of the exon; each pair amplified a product of 250-400 bases.
Identification of Nucleotide Alterations in APC Patients SSCP analysis identifies most single- or multiple-base changes in DNA fragments up to 400 bases in length (Orita et al., 1989a, 1989b). Sequence alterations are detected as shifts in electrophoretic mobility of single-stranded DNA on nondenaturing acrylamide gels; the two complementary strands of a DNA segment usually resolve as two SSCP conformers of distinct mobilities. However, if the sample is from an individual heterozygous for a base-pair variant within the amplified segment, often three or more bands are seen. In some cases, even the sample from a homozygous individual will show multiple bands. Basepair-change variants are identified by differences in pattern among the DNAs of the sample set.
Exons of the candidate genes were amplified by PCR from the DNAs of 81 unrelated APC patients and a control set of 12 normal individuals. The five exons from DPI revealed no unique conformers in the APC patients, although common conformers were observed with exons 2 and 3 in some individuals of both affected and control sets, indicating the presenceof DNA sequence polymorphisms. Likewise, none of the five exons of SRP19 revealed unique conformers in DNA from APC patients in the test panel.

Testing of exons 1 through 14 and primer sets A through N of exon 15 of the DP2.5 gene, however, revealed variant conformers specific to APC patients in exons 7, 8, 10, 11, and 15. These variants were in the unrelated patients 3748, 3480, 3827, 3712, and 3751, respectively (Figures 2A-2E). The PCR-SSCP procedure was repeated for each of these exons in the five affected individuals and in an expanded set of 48 normal controls. The variant bands were reproducible in the APC patients but were not observed in any of the control DNA samples. Additional variant conformers in exons 11 and 15 of the DP2.5 gene were seen; however, each of these was found in both the affected and control DNA sets.
Sequencing of Unique Conformers from APC Patients The five sets of conformers unique to the APC patients were sequenced to determine the nucleotide changes responsible for their altered mobilities. The normal conformers from the host individuals were sequenced also. Bands were cut from the dried acrylamide gels, and the DNA was eluted. PCR amplification of these DNAs provided template for sequencing.
The sequences of the unique conformers from exons 7, 8, 10, and 11 of DP2.5 revealed dramatic mutations in the DP2.5 gene. The sequence of the new mutation creating the exon 7 conformer in patient 3748 was shown to contain a deletion of two adjacent nucleotides, at positions 730 and 731 in the cDNA sequence reported by Joslyn et al. (1991). The normal sequence at this splice junction is CAGAGGTCA (intronic sequence underlined), with the intron-exon boundary between the two repetitions of AG. The mutant allele in this patient has the sequence WGTCA (Figure 3A). Although this change is at the 5' splice site, comparison with known consensus sequences of splice junctions would suggest that a functional splice junction is maintained. If this new splice junction were functional, the mutation would introduce a frameshift that creates a stop codon 15 nucleotides downstream. If the new splice junction were not functional, messenger processing would be significantly altered.
To confirm the 2 base deletion, the PCR product from APC patient 3748 and a control DNA were electrophoresed on an acrylamide-urea denaturing gel, along with the products of a sequencing reaction. The sample from

patient 3746 showed two bands differing in size by 2 nu-

cleotides, with the larger band identical in mobility to the

control sample; this result was independent confirmation

that patient 3746 is heterozygous for a 2 bp deletion (data

not shown).

The unique conformer found in exon 8 of patient 3460

was found to carry a C-T transition, at position 904 in the

published cDNA sequence of DP2.5, which replaced the

normal sequence of CGA with TGA (Figure 3B). This point

mutation, when read in frame, results in a stop codon re-

placing the normal arginine codon. This single-base

change had occurred within the context of a CG dimer, a

potential hot spot for mutation (Barker et al., 1984).

The conformer unique to APC patient 3827 in exon 10

was found to contain a deletion of one nucleotide (1367,

1368, or 1369) when compared to the normal sequence

found in the other bands on the SSCP gel. This deletion,

occurring within a set of three Ts, changed the sequence

fromCTlXAtoCTTCA(Figure3C);

this 1 baseframeshift

creates a downstream stop within 30 bases. The PCR

product amplified from this patient's DNA also was electro-

phoresed on an acrylamide-urea denaturing gel, along

with the PCR product from a control DNA and products

from a sequencing reaction. The patient's PCR product

showed two bands differing by 1 bp in length, with the

larger identical in mobility to the PCR product from the

normal DNA; this result confirmed the presence of a 1 bp

deletion in patient 3827 (data not shown).

Sequence analysis of the variant conformer of exon 11

from patient 3712 revealed the substitution of a T by a G

at position 1500, changing the normal tyrosine codon to a

stop codon (Figure 30).

The pair of conformers observed in exon 15 of the DP2.5

gene from APC patient 3751 also was sequenced. These

conformers were found to carry a nucleotide substitution

of C to G at position 5253, the third base of a valine codon

(Figure 3E). No amino acid change resulted from this sub-

stitution, suggesting that this conformer reflects a geneti-

cally silent polymorphism.

The observation of distinct inactivating mutations in the

DP2.5 gene in four unrelated patients strongly suggested

that DP2.5 is the APC gene.

Transmission of the New Mutation Confirmation that the DP2.5 is, in fact, the APC gene was provided by family studies. Patient 3746, described above as carrying an APC allele with a frameshift mutation, is an affected offspring of two normal parents. The pedigree of this family is shown in Figure 4. Colonoscopy revealed no polyps in either parent nor among the patient's three siblings.
DNA samples from both parents, from the patient's wife, and from their three children were examined. As shown in Figure 4, SSCP analysis of DNA from both of the patient's parents displayed the normal pattern of conformers for exon 7, as did DNA from the patient's wife and one of his offspring. The two other children, however, displayed the same new conformers as their affected father. Testing of the patient and his parents with highly polymorphic VNTR

markers showed a 99.96% likelihood that they are his biological parents.
These observations confirmed that this novel conformer, known to reflect a 2 bp deletion mutation in the DP2.5 gene, appeared spontaneously with APC in this pedigree and was transmitted to two of the children of the affected individual.
APC Polymorphisms Sequencing of variant conformers found among controls as well as individuals with APC has revealed the following polymorphisms in the APC gene: first, in exon 11, at position 1458, a substitution of T to C creating an Rsal restriction site but no amino acid change; and second, in exon 15, at positions 5037 and 5271, substitutions of A to G and G to T, respectively, neither resulting in amino acid substitutions. These nucleotide polymorphisms in the APC gene sequence may be useful for diagnostic purposes.
Genomic Structure of the APC Gene The positions of the exons of the APC gene, and the sequences of the intron-exon boundaries, are shown in Figure 5. The continuity of the very large (6.5 kb), most 3'exon in DP2.5 was shown in two ways. First, inverse PCR with primers spanning the entire length of this exon revealed no divergence of the cDNA sequence from the genomic sequence. Second, PCR amplification with converging primers placed at intervals along the exon generated products of the same size whether amplified from the originally isolated cDNA, cDNA from various tissues, or genomic template. Two forms of exon 9 were found in DP2.5: one is the complete exon; and the other, labeled exon 9A, is

the result of asplice into theinterior of the exon that deletes bases 934 to 1236 in the mRNA and removes 101 amino acids from the predicted protein (see Figure 9 in Joslyn et al., 1991).
Mapping of APC Exons in Somatic Cell Hybrids from Deletion Patients Somatic cell hybrids carrying the segregated chromosomes 5 from the 100 kb (HHW1291) and 260 kb (HHW1155) deletion patients (Joslyn et al., 1991) were used to determine the distribution of the APC gene exons across the deletions. DNAs from these cell lines were used as template, along with genomic DNA from a normal control, for PCR-based amplification of the APC exons.
PCR analysis of the hybrids from the 266 kb deletion of patient 3214 showed that all but one (exon 1) of the APC exons are removed by this deletion (Figure 6A). PCR analysis of the somatic cell hybrid HHW1291, carrying the chromosome 5 homolog with the 100 kb deletion from patient 3824, revealed that exons 1 through 9 are present but exons 10 through 15 are missing (Figure 66). This result placed the deletion breakpoint either between exons 9 and 10 or within exon 10.
Expression Properties Tissues that express the APC gene were identified by PCR amplification of cDNA made to mRNA with primers located within adjacent APC exons. In addition, PCR primers that flank the alternatively spliced exon 9 were chosen so that the expression pattern of both splice forms could be assessed. All tissue types tested (brain, lung, aorta, spleen, heart, kidney, liver, stomach, placenta, and colonic mu-

cosa) and cultured cell lines (lymphoblasts, HL60, and choriocarcinoma) expressed both splice forms of the APC gene (Figure 7). We note, however, that expression by lymphocytes normally residing in some tissues, including colon, prevents unequivocal assessment of expression. The larger mRNA, containing the complete exon 9 rather than only exon 9A, appears to be the more abundant message.
Northern analysis of poly(A)-selected RNA from lymphoblasts revealed a single band of approximately 10 kb, consistent with the size of the sequenced cDNA (data not shown).
Structure of the Predicted Protein Product of the APC Gene The cDNA consensus sequence of APC predicts that the longer, more abundant form of the message codes for a 2844 amino acid peptide with a mass of 311.8 kd (see Figure 9 in Joslyn et al., 1991). This predicted APCpeptide was compared with the current data bases of protein and

DNA sequences using both lntelligenetics and GCG software packages. No genes with a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity were found. Although many short (approximately 20 amino acid) regions of sequence similarity were uncovered, none was sufficiently strong to reveal which, if any, might represent functional homology. Interestingly, multiple similarities to myosins and keratins did appear. The APCgene also was scanned for sequence motifs of known function; although multiple glycosylation, phosphorylation, and myristoylation sites were seen, their significance is uncertain.
Analysis of the APC peptide sequence did identify features important in considering potential protein structure. Hydropathy plots (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) indicate that the APC protein is notably hydrophilic. No hydrophobic domains suggesting a signal peptide or a membranespanning domain were found. Analysis of the first 1000 residues indicates that a-helical rods may form (Cohen and Parry, 1986); there is a scarcity of proline residues and, as shown in Figure 8, there are a number of regions

Cell 594

containing heptad repeats (apolar-X-X-apolar-X-X-X). Interestingly, in exon 9A, the deleted form of exon 9, two heptad repeat regions are reconnected in the proper heptad repeat frame, deleting the intervening peptide region. After the first 1000 residues, the high proline content of the remainder of the peptide suggests a compact rather than a rod-like structure.
The most prominent feature of the second 1000 residues 2898 is a 20 amino acid repeat that is iterated seven times with
semiregular spacing (Table 2). The intervening sequences between the seven repeat regions contained 114, 116,

Discussion
Four inactivating mutations found in APC patients specify DP2.5 as the APC gene. Two of the mutations create stop codons; the other two are frameshift mutations (1 bp and 2 bp deletions) that alter the reading frame and create stop codons immediately downstream. None of these mutations is seen among a panel of unaffected, control samples. Most importantly, however, the 2 bp deletion of patient 3748 is a new mutation; it is found in neither of the parents, both of whom are clinically normal. We conclude

that mutations in DP2.5 are capable of causing APC and that DP2.5 is the APC gene.
Relatively little suggestion as to the function of the APC gene product has been revealed by searching data bases for amino acid sequence similarities with known proteins. The strongest similarities detected are to intermediatefilament structural proteins such as the myosins and keratins. These similarities are due largely to the presence in the predicted peptide of a series of heptad repeat motifs (Cohen and Parry, 1986) that also are found, interestingly, in the MCC gene product (Bourne, 1991). The heptad repeats are believed to be capable of facilitating protein-pro tein interactions through formation of extended a helices that present a series of hydrophobic residues extending along one side. These hydrophobic regions can stabilize

Figure 7. Expression of APC Product in Various Human Tissues, from Exon-Connection Experiments
PCR with primers flanking the alternatively spliced exon shows expression of two products in all tissues examined and a size difference consistent with that predicted by cDNA sequence analysis (303 bp; see Joslyn et al., 1991). The larger form appears to be more abundant in most tissues,
the interaction of two such a helices to form either homo- or heterodimers through the formation of a coiled coil (Cohen and Parry, 1986). However, the short length of the heptad repeat regions in the predicted APC gene product does not suggest an extended filamentous structure and may reflect intrapeptide bundling of a helices.
On theother hand, in thecaseoftheAPCgeneproducts, one of which contains a fusion of two heptad repeat regions, such interactions might result in the formation of multimers containing both kinds of subunits. Moreover, the presence of heptad repeats in the putative product of the closely located MCC gene, which shows mutations in tumors, might permit an interaction between the products of the APC and MCC genes.
In addition to the heptad repeats, multiple potential serine phosphorylation site motifs, glycosylation motifs, and myristoylation sites are found. The functional significance of these potential sites remains to be established. No hydrophobic regions suggesting a transmembrane domain have been found, and the overall hydrophilic nature of the predicted protein suggests that the APC protein may be located in the interior of the cell.

All six of the mutations characterized here in APC patients-two stop codons, two frameshift deletions, and two larger deletions-would be expected to inactivate the AfC gene. These inactivating mutations in the APC gene support the hypothesis that the APC gene is a tumor suppressor, analogous in its formal genetics to the retinoblastoma gene (Knudson et al., 1975). Loss of the chromosome carrying the normal homolog is diagnostic for the presence of a tumor suppressor gene (Cavenee et al., 1985). The significant frequency of loss of chromosome 5 homologs observed in both sporadic and APC colon carcinomas (Solomon et al., 1987; Vogelstein et al., 1988; Okamoto et al., 1988) suggests that, at the cellular level, the mutant alleles of the APC gene are recessive with respect to carcinoma formation.
A distinction between retinoblastoma and colon carcinoma, however, is that in the case of colon carcinoma a well-defined intermediate in the progression pathway, the adenomatous polyp, can be examined. Although the tumor suppressor model might suggest that the adenomatous polyp would likewise show loss of a chromosome 5 homolog, almost none of the polyps of individuals with APC show a chromosome 5 loss (Solomon et al., 1987; Vogelstein et al., 1988). This finding suggests that the inherited APC alleles are dominant with respect to polyp formation, even at the level of the individual cellular precursor. It should be noted that a second event, perhaps a mutation in some other, as yet unidentified, gene, is required for polyp formation, as all of the colonic epithelial cells of an APC patient are heterozygous for the inherited APC mutation, but only a few become precursors to polyps.
Bourne (1991) has recently proposed that dominance with respect to polyp formation of inherited APC mutations could be due to incorporation of altered gene products into a multisubunit structure. However, the finding reported here that four mutant alleles of the APC gene are, in fact, inactivating stop codons and frameshifts seems inconsistent with that model.
Bodmer et al. (1987) have suggested an alternative view of polyp formation, accounting for the dominance of APC alleles with respect to polyp formation and proposing a stochastic basis for the second event. In this view AfC gene mutations reduce the activity of the gene, and polyp formation occurs when the level of activity of the APC gene falls below some critical, orthreshold, value. This hypothesis would be consistent with the gene-inactivating mutations described here, as loss of one allele might be expected to reduce the activity of the APC gene in the cell. If this quantitative view were correct, it might also suggest an explanation for regression of adenomas in APC patients following treatment with the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug sulindac (Waddell et al., 1989). Such treatment might alter the cellular environment in such a way that the threshold requirement for activity of the polyposis gene product is reduced, and lower levelsof APCgene activity might then be sufficient to prevent development or maintenance of the adenoma.
Although missense amino acid substitutions resulting in reduced activity would be expected to arise at a frequency comparable to that of gene-inactivating mutations, such

Figure 8. Structureofthe PredictedAPCGene Product and Amino Acid Sequences of Heptad Repeat Regions

(A)SchematicoftheAPCprotein.

Thefirst 1000

amino acids contain heptad repeat motifs. The

hatched region is coded by the alternative exon

(exon 9) and is absent from the smaller mRNA.

Vertical bars are the seven repeats of 20 ami-

no acids (Table 2); stippling denotes a basic

domain.

(B) Heptad repeats (apolar-X-X-apolar-X-X-X)

present in the first 1000amino acidsoftheAPC

protein. The numbers, based on the longer

gene product, denote the first and last residue

of each repeat block; the apolar residues that

define the repeats appear in boldface. The

three repeat units that are boxed are specific to

the different gene products. Underlined amino

acids in the repeats beginning at residues 305

and 406 are derived from the alternative exon

(exon 9) and are present only in the longer gene

product. Amino acids that are not underlined in

the above repeats become contiguous in prod-

uct derived from the alternative splice of exon

9 and form a heptad repeat block that is specific

to the shorter gene product.

mutations have not yet been seen, Qne reason might be. that, in general, amino acid substitutions are not sufficiently damaging to give the characteristic APC phenok type. Such mutations may be present, therefore, but create a milder phenotype, currently unrecognized as APC.
Families with a high incidence of colon cancer but relatively small numbers of polyps (1 O-20 per patient on average) have been identified recently, and the gene causing the phenotype has been mapped to the APC locus (Leppert et al., 1990; L. S., unpublisheddata). Indeed, allelic heterogeneity at the APC locus was proposed to account for the phenotypic heterogeneity of the APC pedigrees. Evidence for genetic transmission of small numbers of polyps in some families, and the proposition that this transmission is the basis for much of the population risk of colon carcinoma(Cannon-Albright et al., 1988; Burt et al., 1985), suggests that even milder APC'alleles might exist, predispos-

ing a-carrier to the development of only one or a few polyps (Leppert et al., 1990).
The role of MCC, a gene that is mutated in some colonic tumors (Kinzler et al., 1991), in the inherited disorder APC is unresolved. The MCC mutations in carcinomas suggest that the function of this gene is relevant to tumorigenesis. However, the finding of inherited alterations in a different gene in some APC patients, one of them a new mutation that entered the pedigree concurrently with the disease, is evidence that, in these families, an inherited defect in MCC is not the cause of their polyposis phenotype.
Another possibility-suggested by the potential involvement of both the MCC and APC genes in colon/c tumorigenesis, their physical proximity, and the presence in both of heptad repeat motifs-is that the MCC and APC gene products interact, perhaps through heterodimer formation, to form an active structure. If this were true, mutations

Cell 598

in either gene during tumorigenesis might affect the activity of the heterodimer. The failure to find inherited mutations in MCC might then be explained either by the lower mutation frequency expected from a smaller gene, or by lethality of constitutional mutations in MCC.
A more immediate use of the cloned APC gene will be in the development of DNA-based diagnostic tests for the presence of mutant APC alleles. The most effective tests directly detect the presence of a mutant allele in a patient; for now, this level of test will be available only for those relatively few examples where the mutation has been characterized. For the remaining individuals known to be at
risk because of family history, linkage tests involving other family members are required to determine whether they have inherited a mutant APC allele. The several APCgene polymorphisms reported here will be helpful in providing diagnostic information. Furthermore, a multi-allelic CA re-
peat polymorphism present in the very closely colocated DP 7 gene (L. S., unpublished data) should also provide
accurate diagnostic information.

Experimental Procedures

identification of APC Patients APC patients were identified through referrals from private physicians and hospital clinics associated with the diagnosis and treatment of APC. Patients were selected on the basis of their availability and their willingness to donate blood samples. Participating institutions included the following: the Department of Surgery and the Division of
Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, at the University of Utah Medical Center; the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD; St. Mark's Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT; LDS Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; and the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria Medical Center, Peoria, IL. Medical records were obtained and reviewed to verify the correct diagnosis of APC in each patient. All human tissue samples used in this project
were obtained with the approval of the institutional Review Board at the University of Utah Health Sciences Center.

Tissue Culture

Epstein-Barr virus was used to transform lymphocytes from normal

and APC individuals. These lymphoblastoid cell lines then were cui-

tured at 37OC, 5% CO, in RPM1 1640 medium (CeligrolMediatech)

with 1% Nutridoma (Boehringer Mannheim), 5% fetal bovine serum

(Hyclone), and 50 U/ml gentamycin sulfate. Hybrid cell lines were derived as described in Josiyn et al. (1991) and were cultured at 39OC,

5% COn in DMEM (CellgrolMediatech) (Hycione) and 2% penicillin-streptomycin

with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO). Patient DNA was

obtained directly from peripheral blood or from lymphoblastoid cell

lines initiated in our laboratory from patients' blood.

identification of intron-Exon Boundarles Yeast ceils carrying a YAC were grown in 100 ml of YDP medium at 32OC, and DNA was harvested according to published protocols (Ausubel et al., 1989). Two micrograms of total yeast plus YAC DNA (3lOD8) was digested with several enzymes (Sau3A, Haeili, Taqi, Aiul, Hhai, and Mspi). Following digestion, DNAs were phenol extracted, precipitated with 2.5 vois of ethanol, and collected by centrifugation. DNAs were washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, and resuspended in 50 ~1 of TE4 (10 mM Tris [pH 7.51, 0.1 mM EDTA). DNA molecules were ligated to maximize circularization (Ochman et al., 1990), with final DNA concentrations between 0.2 and 2.0 pg/ml. Ligated DNAs were precipitated, washed, and resuspended in 40 @I of TE-4. Five microliters of each ligation was used for PCR experiments.
To obtain genomic sequence flanking putative exons of DP2.5, diverging primers designed within cDNA sequence (Table 3) were used with the above ligation mixtures in PCR reactions (30 cycles; each cycle 1 min at 94'C, 1 min at 52OC, 2 min at 72OC). Amplified products were resolved on 2% agarose gels (Maniatis et al., 1982) and isolated

from the gel with Geneclean (BiolOl, La Jolla, CA). These products were sequenced using the dideoxy termination method (Sanger et al.,
1977) with fluorescentiy tagged Ml 3 primers on an Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

PCR Amplification

DNA samples were amplified for SSCP analysis using the poiymerase

chain reaction (5 min at 95OC, 1 time; 1 min at 95OC. 1 min at annealing

temperature, 1 min at 72OC. 35 times; 10 min at 72OC, 1 time) with the

primer pairs listed in Table 1. The annealing temperature for each

reaction was 2OC-4"C below the T, for the primer. The reaction mix-

ture was made up of the following: 200 ng of DNA, 0.5 pM each primer,

70 PM each deoxynucieoside triphosphate. 10 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 50

mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCI,, 0.01% gelatin, 0.25 U of Taq poiymerase,

0,25mMspermidine,

and0.1 plof [a-"P]dCTP(3000Ci/ml)inavoiume

of 10 pl.

Somatic cell hybrid DNAs were amplified similarly, but in a volume

of 25 ~1, without isotope, and with 1.25 U of Taq polymerase and 2.5

mM dNTPs.

SSCP Gel Analysis PCR products were diluted in 50 pl of 0.1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA and 50

pi of 95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanoi. Products were denatured at 95OC for 3 min and kept

on ice until loaded onto 5% poiyacryiamide gels. Two conditions were run for each set of reactions: a SO mM Tris-borate (pH 7.5). 2 mM

EDTA gel at 4OC, and a 90 mM Tris-borate (pli 7.5). 2 mM EDTA, 10%

glycerol gel at room temperature. Eiectrophoresis was carried out for

both conditions at 40 W, constant power.

After eiectrophoresis, gels were transferred to Whatman 3MM paper

and driedonvacuum slab dryers. Autoradiographywith

KodakX-Omat

AR film and without intensifying screens, overnight, was usually suffi-

cient to detect bands on film.

Sequencing of SSCP Conformers Individual SSCP bands were cut directly from the dried gels, placed in 100 pi of distilled water, shaken for 30 min at roam temperature, and

Df2.5 Is the APC Gene 599

centrifuged briefly. A 10 ul aliquot of this supernatant was used for PCR amplification with the same primer pair that was used in the original amplification. Reaction mixtures were as follows: 0.5 pM each primer, 10 pl of 10x Perkin-Elmer Cetus PCR buffer, and 2.0 ul of a 1.25 mM dNTP mix. Samples were vortexed, spun down, placed on ice, and overlaid with mineral oil. Two units of Taq polymerase was
added to each reaction. Reactions were placed in a preheated DNA thermal cycler at 95°C and run with the following parameters: 95OC, 1 min; 60°C 1 min; 72% 1 min (25 times). Samples were purified by a centrifugation wash with a Centricon 100 column (Amicon). Samples were stored frozen until ready for sequencing on the Applied Biosysterns model 373A DNA sequencer (Applied BioSystems, Foster City,
CA). Samples were sequenced with the dideoxy termination method with Taq polymerase and fluorescently tagged Ml3 universal or reverse sequencing primers.

RNA Preparation and Northern Analysis

RNA was extracted from tissue by the guanidium-acid-phenol

method

described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). Approximately 3 ug of

poly(A)-selected RNA was electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels

containing 0.66 M formaldehyde and blotted overnight onto uncharged

nylon membranes. Probe preparation and hybridization were per-

formed by the methods described above.

Exon Connection
RNA was extracted from tissues as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). cDNA was made through reverse transcription of 1 kg of total RNA, with synthesis primed by random hexamers (Perkin-Elmer Cetus Corp., Norwalk, CT). PCR was then performed on the cDNA (Fearon et al., 1990) using one oligonucleotide primer from exon 6 and a second primer from exon 13. PCR with these same primers on genomic DNA SeNed as a control for contamination of RNA samples with DNA.
