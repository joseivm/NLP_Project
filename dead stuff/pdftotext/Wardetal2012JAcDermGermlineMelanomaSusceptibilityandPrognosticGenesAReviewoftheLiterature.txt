Germline melanoma susceptibility and prognostic genes: A review of the literature
Katherine A. Ward, MD,a DeAnn Lazovich, PhD,b and Maria K. Hordinsky, MDc Minneapolis, Minnesota
In recent years, there have been increasing efforts to identify germline genetic variants that may alter melanoma susceptibility and prognosis. The findings of these studies have indicated the presence of rare, high-penetrance alleles with large effects, such as CDKN2A and CDK4, more common, moderately penetrant genes like MC1R, and very common, low-penetrance polymorphisms with small effects that are related to pigmentation, nevus count, immune responses, DNA repair, metabolism, and the vitamin D receptor. The study of these low-penetrance single nucleotide polymorphisms is relatively new; thus many of them are termed `candidate melanoma susceptibility or prognostic genes.' This review summarizes the research on germline polymorphisms that have been implicated in melanoma susceptibility and prognosis in order to provide a framework for additional studies to meet the ultimate goal of predicting a patient's risk of, and prognosis in, cutaneous malignant melanoma.

INTRODUCTION
It has long been known that mutations in the
CDKN2A and CDK4 genes play a role in familial
melanoma, which comprises approximately 10% of all cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) cases.1-4
Recently, other CMM risk alleles have been found in genes related to pigmentation,5 nevus count,6 immune responses,7 DNA repair,8 metabolism,9 and the vitamin D receptor (VDR).10
The penetrance of these genes in CMM is a
spectrum, with high-risk alleles being CDKN2A
and CDK4, moderate-risk genes including MC1R,
and low-risk alleles such as TYR, ASIP, TYRP1,
OCA2, SLC45A2, GSTM1, CYP2D6, VDR, IL-9
[interleukin 9], IL-10, TNF, HLA-DQB0301, XPC, PLA2G6, and numerous others.1,11-16 The lower
risk alleles are much more prevalent in the pop-
ulation, but their effects are less profound,
whereas the higher risk alleles, although rare,
when present almost always confer a phenotype of CMM.16

The purpose of this review is to provide a synopsis of what is currently known about the relationship between the various high, moderate, and low-risk germline polymorphisms, as well as other candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and susceptibility and prognosis in CMM in order to provide a guide for future larger and more comprehensive research undertakings.

The higher pheomelanin levels associated with these MC1R variant alleles cause the red hair and fair skin phenotype (red hair color [RHC]), also known as the MC1R null phenotype.53 This subpopulation is known to be more sensitive to the effects of UV irradiation, demonstrated by a lack of tanning ability, and is also at increased risk of developing CMM, by mechanisms yet to be fully understood.
Melanoma patients are significantly more likely to carry MC1R variants than are healthy control subjects. In fact, having a MC1R variant carries a 2.2- to 3.9-fold risk of developing melanoma, and the effects of having multiple variants are additive, as carriers of two variants have a 4.1- to 4.8 fold risk.1,19,54 In a recent meta-analysis, 7 MC1R variants (Asp84Glu, Arg142His, Arg151Cys, Ile155Thr, Arg160Trp, Arg163Gln, and Asp294His) were all significantly associated with CMM development, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.85) for Arg163Gln to 2.45 (95% CI, 1.32-4.55) for Ile155Thr, and most were associated with red hair and fair skin or red hair only.55 Another recent study implicated the MC1R variant, R151C, in CMM development in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with an OR of 2.6 (95% CI, 1.3-5.3).56 A previous study also showed a significant association between R151C, in addition to R160W, and D294H MC1R variants (RHC phenotype), carrying a more than two-fold increased risk of melanoma.57 Mossner et al58 confirmed the significant risk associated with R151C with an OR of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.12-2.55), but also added another MC1R variant to the list of susceptibility alleles, D84E, with an OR of 4.96 (95% CI, 1.06-23.13). In a very recent, comprehensive field synopsis and systematic metaanalysis, variant MC1R alleles were correlated with increased risk of CMM with an OR of 1.83 (95% CI, 1.56-2.15) as compared with controls.59
Certain MC1R variants not only act as independent risk factors for melanoma development, but they also serve as modifier alleles, exerting effects on the CDKN2A gene.60,61 MC1R variants have been shown to increase the penetrance of CDKN2A mutations from 50% to 84%, in addition to lowering the mean age of onset by 20 years.1,19,60
LOW-PENETRANCE GENES Pigmentation/nevus counterelated genes
Individuals with fair skin, blond or red hair, who never tan and always burn (Fitzpatrick phototypes I and II) are at the highest risk for CMM development.1,62 As a result of this correlation, there has been a search in recent years to identify pigmentation genes in addition to MC1R that may have an impact on CMM susceptibility.

In a large, recent study of populations of
European descent, a significant association was
found between ASIP, which encodes agouti signal-
ing protein, the antagonist of MSH binding to MC1R,
on chromosome 20q11.22 and CMM, with an OR of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.29-1.64).63 A previous study also
demonstrated a significant association between ASIP
SNPs, rs4911414[T ] and rs1015362[G], and CMM
among European populations, again with an OR of 1.45.64 Another study found a significant association
between these same two ASIP SNPs and CMM, but with an OR of 1.68.65 An Australian genome-wide
association study also indicated the presence of a
melanoma susceptibility locus on chromosome
20q11.22, with an OR of 1.72 for ASIP SNPs, rs910873 and rs1885120.66 However, a study with
423 melanoma cases and 147 controls showed no
association between ASIP polymorphisms and CMM,
possibly because of the low number of control subjects.67
The TYR gene on chromosome 5q34, which
encodes for the tyrosinase protein that affects eye
color and tanning response, has also been implicated in CMM susceptibility.36,68 One study found a signif-
icant association between the Arg402Gln variant and CMM, with an OR of 1.21.12 Bishop et al5 found an
association between a coding variant in TYR and
CMM, with an OR of 1.27. A very recent study found a
significant association between the TYR variant, rs1126809, and CMM risk with an OR of 1.22.59
Two studies have described an interesting inverse
relationship between the TYR Arg402Gln polymor-
phism and generalized vitiligo and CMM. This SNP
confers protection from generalized vitiligo, while
increasing susceptibility to CMM among Europeanderived white individuals.5,63
Another candidate melanoma susceptibility gene
is TYRP1 on chromosome 9p23, encoding for
tyrosine-related protein 1, which stabilizes tyrosinase.12 One study found that the TYRP1 variant,
rs1408799, actually decreased the risk of CMM by an OR of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.60-0.98).65 Chatzinasiou et al59 demonstrated a significant association be-
tween the TYRP1 variant, rs1408799, and protection
from CMM (OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80-0.93]).
OCA2 (human type II oculocutaneous albinismerelated gene) is another candidate melanoma susceptibility gene located on chromosome 15q11.212.12 The protein encoded by this gene is a melano-
somal transmembrane protein that modifies human eye color and pigmentation.41,69 Fernandez et al62
found a variant allele of this gene, R419Q
(rs1800407), to significantly increase the risk of
CMM by an OR of 1.55 (95% CI, 1.04-3.31). An earlier
study also found an association between CMM and

the OCA2 locus, with a P value of .030.5 Another
study implicated OCA2 polymorphisms and mole count, which is positively correlated with CMM.41
SLC45A2 (MATP) is a gene on chromosome
5p13.3 that is involved in normal human pigmenta-
tion and has recently been investigated as a CMM susceptibility candidate gene.12,70 A Spanish popu-
lation study found that the SLC45A2 variant allele,
rs16891982 (p.Phe374Leu), was associated with pro-
tection from CMM development, with an OR of 0.41 (95% CI, 0.24-0.70).70 A recent French study ex-
hibited similar findings, as the SLC45A2 variant,
p.Phe374Leu, was again found to be significantly
and strongly protective for CMM, with an OR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.34-0.43).71 Nan et al65 found a different SLC45A2 variant, 1721 C[G, to be significantly associated with a reduction in risk for CMM, with
an OR of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95). A recent study
found the SLC45A2 variant, 16891982, to be associated with a decreased CMM risk with an OR of 0.40.59
Finally, a fifth study found an association with CMM
and the SLC45A2 variants, rs28777, rs35391, and rs16891982.72
A variant in the MYO7A gene was recently de-
scribed in a single study as being associated with
CMM susceptibility. The variant, S1666C (rs2276288),
had an increased risk of CMM development, with an
OR of 1.35 (95% CI, 1.04-1.76), although its

association appeared to be stronger among certain phenotypic groups.62
Increased nevus counts occurring on sun-
exposed sites is a well-known risk factor for CMM development.6,73 Both benign and dysplastic nevi
are presumed to be precursors for CMM, but dys-
plastic melanocytic nevi are believed to be associated with a higher risk of CMM transformation.74
Two genetic variants, at 9p21 and 22q13, have
recently been identified by genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) to be associated with melanocytic nevi development.75
A recent GWAS identified a novel susceptibility locus for nevus count and CMM risk.76 This gene,
known as nidogen 1 (NID1) on 1q42, produces a
member of the nidogen family of basement mem-
brane proteins involved in basement membrane
assembly and is a biologically plausible locus for nevogenesis and melanoma development.76 Results
of the study indicated that increased expression of
nidogen in one variant NID1 SNP (rs10754833 T
allele) was significantly associated with decreased CMM risk (OR, 0.86) (Table I).76
A recent study reported that the SNPs of 5 genes
mentioned above (MC1R, SLC45A2, OCA2, TYR, and
ASIP) explain approximately one third to one half of
the difference in risk of CMM due to pigmentation phenotype.72 However, other pigmentation-related

CMM candidate susceptibility genes have begun to be researched and include KIT, KITLG, IRF, HERC2, PAX3, EDNRB, ADTB3A, CHS1, MLANA, ATRN, SOX10, HPS, MGRN1, MYO5A, SLC24A4, and PLA2G6 (see Table I). The study of these genes is relatively new, but most are related to the production or transport of melanin, hair color, tanning ability, nevus counts, or melanocyte proliferation, differentiation, and survival.14,62,77-79 To date, results on these candidate genes and relationship to CMM development have been unrevealing, but more studies are warranted to assess the effects of these and other pigmentation genes on CMM susceptibility.
Immune-related genes There is much evidence that indicates CMM
patients develop an immune-mediated response to their tumors.80,81 However, in most cases the immune response is insufficient to halt tumor growth. This is especially evident in immunosuppressed transplant patients, as they exhibit higher than normal rates of CMM development.82,83 It is possible, then, that allelic variations in the genes controlling the immune response may be one avenue to which differences in CMM susceptibility and prognosis may be attributed.80 A number of immune-modulating genes have been examined in relation to CMM in the past two decades (see Table I).
Differences in ability to produce IL-10 have been widely studied and may be relevant in the development and course of CMM, most likely due to its immunosuppressor and anti-angiogenic properties.84 The major IL-10 promoter haplotypes are GCC, ACC, and ATA formed by SNPs IL-10-1087AG, IL-10-824CT, and IL-10-597AC, with GCC/GCC (GG) being high in vitro IL-10 producers, GCC/ACC and GCC/ATA (AG) as medium producers, and ACC/ACC, ACC/ATA, and ATA/ATA (AA) defined as low producers.11,84-86
Recent findings have implicated low producing IL-10 haplotypes in CMM susceptibility and poor prognosis. Alonso et al84 reported that the low producer À1082AA genotype was significantly associated with decreased survival in CMM patients with advanced disease (Table II). A recent casecontrol study found that the IL-10 higher producing haplotype ITAGC was found to be significantly associated with a reduced risk of CMM development (P = 0.02).11 A previous study did not find a correlation of the above-mentioned SNPs with CMM susceptibility, but did find an association with prognosis; the IL-10 low-producing haplotypes were significantly linked to the poor prognostic indicator of increased tumor thickness and decreased survival time (see Table II).87 Two other studies reported

significant associations between the IL-10 low-
producing haplotypes and poor disease outcome and/or susceptibility in CMM (see Table II).7,88
However, Dummer et al89 reported results in
opposition to these findings, with increased IL-10
levels in CMM patients with metastatic disease.
Another study identified IL-10 as a growth factor of melanoma cells in vitro.90 One study also reported
that an IL-10 low-producing haplotype was associ-
ated with prolonged survival in CMM patients with
metastases, but a more recent study found that the
low-producing AA genotypes were associated with more rapid progression (see Table II).91,92
Because of the immunogenicity of melanoma tu-
mors, other cytokines have also been researched in
relation to susceptibility and prognosis (see Table I). One study investigated SNPs associated with IL-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and interferon gamma (IFN-g) and
susceptibility and prognosis in CMM and found that
none of the cytokines had any significant association with susceptibility, and only the IL-1b-511 TT geno-
type had an association with prognosis, as it was correlated with thinner tumors (see Table II).80
Another study researched the influence of tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-a) and lymphotoxin-alfa (LT-a) on CMM and reported that the TNF-a -238
GG genotype was significantly associated with in-
creased susceptibility and the GA genotype showed a
significant association with decreased susceptibility, whereas LT-a 1252 genotype may have had a prognostic correlation with increased mitotic count in vertical growth phase tumors (see Table II).93
Another study did not find any susceptibility or prognostic associations between IL-6 or IFN-g and CMM.87 However, Gu et al82 evaluated the associations be-
tween IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 and the IL receptor genes,
IL-4R, IL-6R, and IL-10R, and CMM susceptibility; they
reported that 4 SNPs in the IL-6R gene were associated
with an increased risk of CMM, but none of the other genes exhibited any other associations.83 Finally, another study found that the interferon-g 1874A/T gene polymorphism independently predicted overall survival in CMM patients (see Table II).91
The association between human leukocyte anti-
gen (HLA) class II loci and CMM is a topic of
widespread debate as it has been postulated that
this relationship might be the immunogenetic basis for melanoma susceptibility.94,95 In an early study of
45 Caucasian patients with CMM, Lee et al reported
that 56% carried the HLA class II allele, DQB1*0301,
versus only 27% of Caucasian controls (P = .003);
additionally, the allele was associated with advanced
disease at diagnosis, with 44% of the DQB1*0301-
positive patients presenting with metastases com-
pared with only 5% of DQB1*0301-negative patients

(P = 0.003) (see Table II).96 Another study by these same authors found that stage I or II CMM patients who carried the HLA-DQB1*0301 allele were at an increased risk of developing recurrent disease compared with stage-matched patients who were DQB1*0301-negative (see Table II).97
A study among the Spanish population indicated that the contribution of HLA class II alleles to CMM susceptibility was not significant, but did report a statistically significant increase in HLA-DQA1 homozygosity among CMM patients versus controls and a significant association between HLA-DQB1*0301 and red or fair-haired persons (relative risk, 5.65).94 A variety of other studies have reported even more conflicting results with HLA-DQB1*0301 among CMM populations. One study reported no association between DQB1*0301 and risk of CMM,98 whereas another found a slight, but not significant, positive association with susceptibility,99 and yet another indicated a negative association with risk of CMM.100 The variability of these results could, in part, be due to sample size, patient series heterogeneity, control populations, or technical differences in detecting HLA genotype.94
Other studies have shown associations between CMM and additional HLA alleles. Negative associations were found between DQB1*0302/0303 and CMM, whereas a positive association was found for DQB1*0501 in two Italian studies.99,100 In Japanese patients with CMM, a positive association was found with DQB1*0302, whereas negative associations were reported for DRB1*0802 and DQA1*0101/ 0104/0401.101 Finally, in a British population, an increase in the frequency of DQB1*0303 was found among CMM patients.102
Another candidate CMM susceptibility gene that has recently been investigated is the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). ICAM-1 appears to play a role in the inflammatory and immune response through its interaction with the leukocyte integrins leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and Mac-1.103,104 Higher levels of ICAM-1 may therefore interfere with lymphocyte recognition of tumor cells and lymphocyte localization.104-106 In one study, individuals carrying at least one variant ICAM-1 SNP R241 allele (conferring increased ICAM-1 expression) versus wild-type GG genotype had a 4.3 relative risk of melanoma (P = .022).103 However, in this study, the CMM patient and control sample sizes each only numbered 59, so larger studies are needed to confirm this preliminary finding.
DNA repairerelated genes UV irradiation is the major environmental risk
factor for melanoma.36 The body's main defense

against UV-induced DNA damage (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts) is the nucleotide excision repair pathway.107 Many genes implicated in this pathway have been examined in relation to CMM (see Table I).
A recent meta-analysis found a significant association between the XPD/ERCC2 SNP rs13181 variant C allele and CMM susceptibility, with an OR of 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21).8 Povey et al107 analyzed multiple genes, including ERCC1, XPD, XPF, XPG, XRCC1, OGG1, XRCC3, GSTT1, and p53, but only found significant associations between ERCC1 and XPF and CMM, especially in CMM patients who are 50 years of age and younger (ERCC1 OR = 1.59 and XPF OR = 1.69).107 Another recent study found only one significant association out of 13 different polymorphisms in 8 DNA repair genes; in XRCC3; carriers of variant alleles had a decreased risk of CMM (OR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.79-0.98).108 An additional study reported a significant association between MGMT haplotypes and CMM risk, with a greater risk observed among 84Phe or 143Val carriers, who have a lower alkylation-damage repair capacity due to the variant alleles.109
One study focused on the effects of two DNA repair genes (XRCC1 and APEX1) and prognosis in CMM; a significant association was reported between the AA genotype of the R399Q XRCC1 polymorphism and CMM, which showed a median overall survival of 24.4 years compared with 11.5 years for two other genotypes (hazard ratio of 0.40) and a median metastasis-free survival of 20.9 years versus 5.3 for two other genotypes (hazard ratio of 0.32) (see Table II).110 This same study also found a significant association for -77 T[C XRCC1 and survival following the first metastasis, with a hazard ratio of 1.73 (see Table II). An additional study found an association between ERCC1 polymorphisms at codon 118 (TT and CT genotypes) and increased response to biochemotherapy and overall survival in CMM (see Table II).91
Another study evaluated MDM2 SNP309 (implicated in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway) and its role in CMM and reported that at ages younger than 50 years, women with a GG genotype had a 3.89 times greater chance of being diagnosed with CMM than women with TG or TT genotypes (P = .01).111 Additionally, one study reviewed the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in CMM patients and found that no mutation was present in any of the 92 familial melanoma cases.112 Li et al113 reported a significant association between APEX1 and CMM, with an OR of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42-0.83), but another study by the same authors114 failed to find an association for XPC.

An additional study analyzed the effects of various genes involved in regulation of telomerase activity, which is widely known to cause elongation of telomeres in tumor cells. This study found a significant association between SNPs in the TERT1 and TRF1 genes and increased CMM risk, with the OR ranging from 1.43 to 1.87.115 This study115 also found a decreased risk of CMM in the TERT-CLPTMIL locus, with an OR of 0.73 (see Table I).
Metabolism-related genes Epidemiological studies over the past few de-
cades have indicated that CMM is related to both UV exposure and host factors. Since UV irradiation generates reactive oxygen species that are damaging to DNA, the extent of damage done and potential for carcinogenesis is dependent on how the body metabolizes and detoxifies these oxygen radicals.9 A variety of host metabolic factors have been investigated as possible CMM susceptibility genes for this reason (see Table I).
Three studies have reviewed inactivating polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450-debrisoquine hydroxylase locus (CYP2D6) in relation to melanoma, with homozygotes for mutant alleles being termed poor metabolizers.1 The first study found no significant difference in the frequency of CYP2D6 poor metabolizers between 127 CMM cases and 720 controls, but did find a significant increase in the number of mutant alleles in the CMM cases (P = .02).116 A second study found no significant associations between the number of CYP2D6 mutant alleles among cases and controls in the Slovene population.117 Strange et al118 reported a significant increase in frequency of homozygosity for the mutant CYP2D6 alleles in the 333 CMM cases compared with the 467 controls (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9) among Northern European Caucasians. Larger studies are warranted to confirm a true increase in CMM susceptibility with mutant CYP2D6 alleles.119
The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), involved in detoxification of drugs and potential carcinogens, have also been examined in CMM.120-122 Homozygosity of null alleles in GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes result in decreased production of the corresponding enzymes and increased cancer susceptibility.120,123 One study in the Swedish population examined the GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null, and GSTP1 GG genotypes, and no significant differences were seen in frequency of these genotypes between CMM patients and controls.120 However, there was a significant association between the GSTM1 null genotype and tumor Breslow thickness greater than 2.5 mm (poor prognostic indicator) as well as a particular type of CMM, nodular (see Table II).120 In

contrast, an earlier study did report a significantly higher portion of controls (n = 47) with measurable GSTM1 levels than CMM patients (n = 197), with 51% versus 42%, respectively (P = .002).9 Kanetsky et al124 did not find an association between GSTM1 null or GSTT1 null genotypes and CMM patients, but did report that CMM patients with red or blond hair were twice as likely to carry GSTM1 null and nearly 10-fold more likely to carry both GSTM1 null and GSTT1 null genotypes compared with controls without CMM. A more recent study did not find any statistically significant difference between GSTM1, GSTT1, or GSTP1 genotypes in CMM patients and healthy controls in the Slovenian population.125
Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms There is evidence to suggest that vitamin D exerts
antiproliferative, prodifferentiation, proapoptotic, and antiangiogenic effects on cells, including melanoma cells.126-129 The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is an intracellular hormone receptor that binds the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D or calcitriol, to mediate its effects by interacting with response elements of target genes.128 The VDR gene is located on chromosome 12p12-q14 and has been investigated as a CMM susceptibility gene, with the idea that certain SNPs, including FokI, BsmI, TaqI, ApaI, and A-1012G may alter activity of the VDR and, in effect, act similarly to a systemic deficiency of vitamin D, which has been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers (including CMM) in many epidemiological studies (see Table I).10,130,131
In an early study, the FokI, but not TaqI polymorphism was associated with an altered susceptibility to CMM, with the wild-type FF genotype associated with a risk reduction of 23.7%.9 Another relatively early study reported a novel association between the variant BsmI genotype bb and increased CMM susceptibility (P = .02), but no association for FokI or A-1012G.126 However, Halsall et al132 found that the A allele of A-1012G was more frequent in CMM patients than in controls (P = .011). A case-control study investigated the combined effects of TaqI, BsmI, and FokI polymorphisms on CMM risk and reported that the tBF and tBf haplotypes were both significantly associated with a reduced melanoma risk (OR of 0.52 and 0.51, respectively) when the putative risk alleles, T, b, and f were used as a referent.133 An earlier study exhibited similar results when the TaqI and FokI polymorphisms were examined, with a reduced risk of CMM with the Tt1tt genotypes (OR of 0.70) compared with the TT genotype, and an increased risk with the Ff genotype (OR of 1.32) compared with the FF genotype.131 In a

meta-analysis of 10 studies, the summary relative risks (SRRs) for the FokI polymorphisms Ff and ff versus wild-type were 1.21 and 1.21, respectively, whereas the SRR for the BsmI polymorphisms Bb and BB versus wild-type were 0.78 and 0.75, respectively.134
In addition to their role in CMM susceptibility, VDR polymorphisms have also been implicated in CMM prognosis. Hutchinson et al10 reported that homozygosity for both FokI and TaqI variant alleles was significantly associated with thicker tumors ( $ 3.5 mm; P = .001; OR of 31.5), with Breslow thickness being the most important prognostic indicator in CMM (see Table II). Another study reported a significant association between BsmI polymorphisms and Breslow thickness, with the variant bb alleles being associated with tumors of the greatest mean Breslow thickness and the wild-type BB alleles correlating with the lowest mean Breslow thickness tumors (see Table II).126 In a recent cohort study, Newton-Bishop et al135 reported that higher 25hydroxyvitamin D3 levels were associated with lower Breslow thickness at diagnosis (P = .002) and were independently protective of relapse and death.
CONCLUSIONS While two of the rare, high-penetrance genetic
variants (CDKN2A and CDK4) responsible for some of the familial melanomas have been identified, we are far from understanding all of the genetics behind the majority of CMMs. It is likely that a large number of SNPs, each with a small effect and low penetrance, in addition to the small number of large effect, highpenetrance SNPs, are responsible for CMM risk. Unfortunately, it is likely to be challenging and technically difficult to identify the remaining polymorphisms that have an effect on CMM susceptibility and prognosis. In addition, the published research to date has various flaws that make it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the effects of these lowpenetrance SNPs, such as small sample size, hospitalbased controls, failure to record a major confounding variable, for example, UV irradiation exposure, a small number of studies on various individual SNPs, as well as others. In addition, it should be noted that even GWAS have significant limitations, including the fact that many of the platforms used in the studies do not always cover the exact genes mentioned. Rather, the SNPs are found near the gene loci and thus remain speculative.
This review was intended to provide a summary of the research on the known germline SNPs that have been implicated in CMM susceptibility and prognosis. The ultimate goal of this research is to pinpoint patients who are known to have a genetic

predisposition to CMM so that steps can be taken to ensure early detection or more intense treatment in individuals with poor prognostic indicators so as to minimize morbidity and mortality from this deadly skin cancer.
However, to date, science is far from achieving this, as both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Melanoma Genetics Consortium (GenoMEL) do not advocate the use of routine clinical genetic testing until there is further evidence to indicate clinical utility.136,137 With no widely accepted guidelines in place, it remains difficult for clinicians to discuss the risks and benefits of genetic testing with patients.138 Reasons for recommending against routine genetic testing are as follows: (1) most families with hereditary CMM have no detected mutations; (2) our understanding of CMM risk to carriers is limited; (3) other factors (ie, UV irradiation) appear to affect penetrance; and (4) negative testing may provide false reassurance, as up to 9% of noncarriers in CDKN2A-positive families have been reported to develop CMM.136 So, where does this leave clinicians? Should anyone be tested? What about genetic testing for prognosis? These are important questions and, unfortunately, clinicians are without definitive answers at this time. Additional studies are needed and warranted to further evaluate the role of the abovementioned and other yet-to-be-discovered SNPs, in order to make genetic testing for CMM possible.
