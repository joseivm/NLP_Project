ABSTRACT
Purpose The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of deleterious mutations in the RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D genes to invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) in the population and in a screening trial of individuals at high risk of ovarian cancer.
Patients and Methods The coding sequence and splice site boundaries of the three RAD51 genes were sequenced and analyzed in germline DNA from a case-control study of 3,429 patients with invasive EOC and 2,772 controls as well as in 2,000 unaffected women who were BRCA1/BRCA2 negative from the United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UK_FOCSS) after quality-control analysis.
Results In the case-control study, we identified predicted deleterious mutations in 28 EOC cases (0.82%) compared with three controls (0.11%; P  .001). Mutations in EOC cases were more frequent in RAD51C (14 occurrences, 0.41%) and RAD51D (12 occurrences, 0.35%) than in RAD51B (two occurrences, 0.06%). RAD51C mutations were associated with an odds ratio of 5.2 (95% CI, 1.1 to 24; P  .035), and RAD51D mutations conferred an odds ratio of 12 (95% CI, 1.5 to 90; P  .019). We identified 13 RAD51 mutations (0.65%) in unaffected UK_FOCSS participants (RAD51C, n  7; RAD51D , n  5; and RAD51B, n  1), which was a significantly greater rate than in controls (P  .001); furthermore, RAD51 mutation carriers were more likely than noncarriers to have a family history of ovarian cancer (P  .001).
Conclusion These results confirm that RAD51C and RAD51D are moderate ovarian cancer susceptibility genes and suggest that they confer levels of risk of EOC that may warrant their use alongside BRCA1 and BRCA2 in routine clinical genetic testing.

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has a significant heritable component. A woman with a single firstdegree relative diagnosed with ovarian cancer has a three-fold increased risk of the disease.1,2 Twin studies suggest that most of the familial clustering results from inherited genetic factors.3 High-penetrance mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are associated with the majority of breast-ovarian cancer syndrome occurrences.4-6 The cumulative estimated risks of

ovarian cancer averaged across all possible polygenic risk modifiers by age 70 years are 36% in BRCA1 carriers and 12% in BRCA2 carriers.7
Other ovarian cancer susceptibility genes include the mismatch repair genes MSH6, MSH2, and MLH1,8 which also are associated with colorectal and endometrial cancers. Several common low-penetrance susceptibility alleles conferring relative risks (RRs) of less than 1.5-fold have been found using genome-wide association studies.9-17 The known high-risk susceptibility genes account for approximately 40% of the excess

familial risk of EOC,18 whereas rare moderate-risk variants and common low-risk variants contribute less than 5%.15 Identification of additional susceptibility genes that confer RRs greater than 2 could decrease mortality as a result of ovarian cancer through surgical intervention (eg, riskreducing salpingo-oophorectomy [RRSO]) in at-risk individuals. Recent advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled the rapid, targeted analysis of multiple candidate genes in large populations and have recently identified some novel susceptibility genes for ovarian cancer, including RAD51C,19 RAD51D,20 and BRIP1.21 Existing data suggest that the population prevalence of germline mutations in these genes is low, but the published risk estimates (albeit on the basis of small sample sizes) suggest genetic testing of these genes may have clinical utility. RAD51D mutations were associated with a 6.3-fold increase in risk (95% CI, 2.9 to 14),20 whereas BRIP1 mutations were associated with an 8.1-fold increased risk of ovarian cancer (95% CI, 4.7 to 14).21
The aims of this study were to establish the prevalence and penetrance of deleterious mutations in the three interacting doublestrand DNA break repair genes RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Participants The 3,447 confirmed invasive EOC cases and 2,812 unaffected controls
were from four population-based ovarian cancer case-control studies (AOC [Australian Ovarian Cancer Study], MAL [Malignant Ovarian Cancer Study], SEA [Studies of Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Cancer Heredity], and UKO [United Kingdom Ovarian Cancer Population Study]), one clinic-based casecontrol study (MAYO [Mayo Clinic Ovarian Cancer Study]), one familial ovarian cancer series of cases and matched controls from Poland (POC [Poland ovarian cancer study]), and two familial ovarian cancer registries from the United Kingdom and United States (UKR [United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry] and GRR [Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry]). These studies have been previously described (Table 1 and Appendix Table A1, online only). Forty-three duplicate samples and four RAD51C mutation­positive controls were included for quality control.
Also included were 2,000 unaffected participants enrolled onto the United Kingdom Familial Ovarian Cancer Screening Study (UK_FOCSS).22 Eligible participants were women age  35, with an estimated lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of  10% on the basis of a family history of ovarian and/or breast cancer and/or the presence of known predisposing germline gene mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2, and MMR genes) in the family. Volunteers were

recruited between June 2002 and September 2010 from 42 United Kingdom regional centers. All participants were tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and carriers were excluded from this study.
All studies had approval from the appropriate ethics committee, and all study participants provided written, informed consent.
Sequencing Library Preparation and Sequencing We used the 48.48 Fluidigm Access Arrays (Fluidigm, San Francisco,
CA) for target sequence enrichment, as described previously8 and according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RAD51 genes were in a panel of 11 genes sequenced in SEA and MAYO and in a panel of six genes in the remaining studies. The results for the other genes have been reported previously8 or are unpublished. Fifty-six primer pairs were designed to cover the exons and splice sites of RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D (Appendix Table A2, online only) with a combined sequencing target of 4 kb. The primer design achieved greater than 95% coverage of the target sequence. Sequencing libraries were quantified by using a KAPA library quantification kit (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, MA) with specific probes for the ends of the adapters according to the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence libraries were sequenced using single-end sequencing on the Illumina GAII (Illumina, San Diego, CA) or paired end sequencing on the Illumina HiScan (Illumina) or Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each lane sequenced 384 barcoded samples.
Sequence Data Analysis Sequenced reads were demultiplexed with standard Illumina software.
We used the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)23 for sequencing read alignment against the human genome reference sequence (UCSC hg19; University of California Santa Cruz Genome Reference Consortium; http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway). The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK; https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)24 was used for base quality-score recalibration, local insertion/deletion (indel) realignment, and variant (substitution and indel) discovery. Variants were considered only if they satisfied the set of recommended GATK filters, as described in the GATK best practices guide. ANNOVAR (http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/ en/latest/)25 was used to annotate the sequence variation detected. We used PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/bgi.shtml),26 SIFT (http://sift.bii.a-star.edu.sg/),27 and Provean (http://provean.jcvi.org/protein_ batch_submit.php?specieshuman)28 to predict the function of missense variants. We used MaxEntScan (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/ bgi.shtml)29 to predict the pathogenic potential of possible splicing variants in sequences from 3 base pairs (bp) in the exon to 20 bp in the intron for the 3= acceptor sites and 3 bp in the exon and 6 bp in the intron for the 5= donor sites. Variants with a MaxEntScan score that decreased by more than 40% compared with the consensus sequence were assumed to affect splicing.
The alternate allele frequency (Altfreq) for each variant detected in each sample was defined as the fraction of alternative allele reads compared with the

total number of reads at that position. We applied thresholds for variant calling, as defined previously8: With a minimum read depth of 15, alternate allele heterozygotes were called if the depth was  500 and the Altfreq was  10%; if the depth ranged from 250 to less than 500 and the Altfreq was  15%; if the depth ranged from 30 to less than 250 and the Altfreq was  20%; or if the depth ranged from 15 to less than 30 and the Altfreq was  30%. Samples with fewer than 80% of the target bases covered at a read depth of  15 (40 controls and 18 cases) were excluded. We defined deleterious variants as those predicted to result in protein truncation (frameshift indels, consensus
splice site substitutions, and nonsense substitutions) or those missense muta-
tions that have been previously reported as deleterious on the basis of in vitro analysis19,30 or predicted by MaxEntScan to affect splicing.
Ninety percent of the target sequence bases had read depths  15. The coverage for the three genes is summarized in Appendix Table A2. Concor-
dance for variants called in the 43 duplicate samples was 100%. Four RAD51C
mutation­positive controls also were detected.

Mutation Validation We visually inspected the sequence alignments for all of the called
deleterious variants by using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA; https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/). We validated all deleterious variants by polymerase chain reaction amplification and Sanger sequencing.31
Statistical Methods We tested for an association between deleterious mutations and
ovarian cancer risk by using unconditional logistic regression adjusted for the country of origin (Australia, Denmark, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Odds ratios and associated 95% CIs also were calculated with data from the case-control studies that were not family based (AOC, MAL, MAYO, SEA, and UKO).
We estimated the cumulative risk of ovarian cancer with equation 1 by applying the estimated odds ratio (RR) to population incidence data for England from 201132:
Cumulative risk  1  ecumulative incidence
See the Data Supplement for a spreadsheet with calculations. We identified multiple missense variants that have unknown functional
effects on the protein. We excluded all missense variants that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) of greater than 1% from additional analyses, because largescale genome-wide association studies have shown that the RR conferred by a common susceptibility allele are small (RR  1.3) and thus not detectable by the smaller sample size of this targeted-sequencing study. The statistical power to detect single rare alleles by association, even if they confer larger risk (RR  2), is still modest. Therefore, we used the rare admixture likelihood (RAML) burden test33 to test for an association on a gene-by-gene basis. The RAML test combines the data for multiple variants and allows for alleles associated with either an increased or a decreased risk. We classified variants with an MAF  1% into three groups: deleterious variants as defined previously (these were excluded from the RAML analyses); variants predicted to have a damaging effect on protein function by at least two of three prediction tools (SIFT [score  0.05], PolyPhen-2 [classified as probably damaging/damaging], and Provean [score  2.5]); and variants with probable benign effects. Only patients who had a call rate greater than 80% for missense variants and variants that had a call rate greater than 80% and genotype frequencies consistent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P  105) were included in these analyses.
RESULTS
Deleterious RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D Mutations in Ovarian Cancer Cases and Controls
Sequence data for the coding regions and splice site boundaries of RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D were available for 3,429 invasive EOC cases and 2,772 controls after quality control (Table 1). We

identified 135 unique variants, of which eight (5.9%) were frameshift indels, 10 (7.4%) were nonsense substitutions, five (3.7%) were predicted splice site alterations, and 113 (78%) were missense substitutions. Of the 113 missense variants, one (RAD51C 428AG) was deleterious,30 105 had an MAF less than 1%, and seven (5.1%) had an MAF greater than 1%.
We identified deleterious mutations in two cases for RAD51B, 14 cases and two controls for RAD51C, and 12 cases and one control for RAD51D. Of these, 23 deleterious mutation carriers were identified in 3,135 cases (0.73%) unselected for family history (Table 2 and Appendix Table A3, online only). One case had two deleterious mutations close to each other and in cis (G217X and Q219X) in RAD51D. The prevalence of deleterious mutations was significantly higher (P  .001) in cases (28 of 3,429; 0.82%) than in controls (three of 2,772; 0.11%). Eight deleterious mutations were detected in more than one individual. Three of these (RAD51C 732delT and A428G and RAD51D C898T) were identified in a case and a control. Of the 29 predicted deleterious variants in cases, 22 (76%) were frameshift indels or nonsense variants, six (21%) were splice site substitutions, and one (3.4%) was a missense variant previously reported as deleterious.30
We also evaluated the prevalence of RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D variants in 2,000 individuals from UK_FOCSS. We identified 149 unique variants, of which three (2.0%) were frameshift indels, three (2.0%) were nonsense substitutions, two (1.3%) were predicted splice site alterations, and 141 (95%) were missense substitutions. Thirteen participants carried one of the eight different deleterious mutations in one of these genes (one in RAD51B, seven in RAD51C, and five in RAD51D). The overall prevalence (0.65%) was significantly greater than that of the general population controls (P  .001; Table 3).
Ovarian Cancer Risks Associated With RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D Mutations
The odds ratio (adjusted for country of origin) associated with a deleterious mutation in any of the three genes was 8.1 (95% CI, 2.4 to 27; P  .001) for all ovarian cancer subtypes and 9.3 (95% CI, 2.7 to 32; P  .001) for the serous subtype. Gene-specific odds ratios (adjusted for country of origin) for all ovarian cancer subtypes were 5.2 for RAD51C (95% CI, 1.1 to 24; P  .035) and 12 for RAD51D (95% CI, 1.5 to 90; P  .019). Gene-specific odds ratios for the serous subtype were 7.4 for RAD51C (95% CI, 1.6 to 35; P  .011) and 12 for RAD51D

(95% CI, 1.5 to 97; P  .021). The estimated average cumulative risks of ovarian cancer by age 50 were 1.3% (95% CI, 0.3% to 6.0%) for RAD51C and 3.0% (95% CI, 0.4% to 21%) for RAD51D. The equivalent risks by age 70 were 5.2% (95% CI, 1.1% to 22%) for RAD51C and 12% (95% CI, 1.5% to 60%) for RAD51D.
Clinicopathologic Characteristics Associated With RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D Mutations
The clinical and histopathologic characteristics of all patient cases are listed in Appendix Table A1. Mutation carriers were more likely than noncarriers to have high-grade serous versus other histologic subtypes (P  .046; Table 4). Eighteen percent of mutation carriers were diagnosed at ages 40 to 49 years, and no mutation carrier was diagnosed with ovarian cancer before age 40 years (Table 4). Carriers of a mutation in any of the RAD51 genes were more likely than noncarriers to have a family history of ovarian cancer, although this difference was not statistically significant (24% v 14%; P  .16 for all genes). The proportion of RAD51C mutation carriers with a family history was higher (36%; P  .021; Table 5). In UK_FOCSS participants, mutation carriers were also more likely than noncarriers to be associated with a family history of ovarian cancer (Table 3); 9 of 13 mutation carriers (69%) compared

with 548 of 1,987 noncarriers (28%) had a family history comprising two or more ovarian cancer cases in first- or seconddegree relatives (P  .001).
RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D Missense Variants and Ovarian Cancer Risk
We used three bioinformatics tools (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and Provean) to predict the effects on protein function of 112 missense variants. Thirty missense variants were classified as deleterious by all three tools, 12 missense variants by at least two of three tools, and 15 variants by one of three tools; 55 missense variants were predicted to be neutral by all three tools (Appendix Table A4). For the 38 missense variants with an MAF  1% and predicted by at least two of three tools to have a functional effect, we compared the relative burden in cases and controls for each gene with the RAML test.33 We found some evidence for an association of the rare missense variation in RAD51C with an increased risk of ovarian cancer for all ovarian cancer subtypes (RAML test P  .029), and the effect was stronger for the serous subtype (RAML test P  .001). We also found some evidence of an association of missense variants in RAD51D with an increased risk of serous ovarian cancer (P  .012). There was little evidence of an association of rare missense variants in RAD51B and RAD51D with all ovarian cancer subtypes or in RAD51B with serous ovarian cancer (P  .05).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this study is the largest population-based ovarian cancer study to date to estimate the prevalence of mutations in the RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D genes. Overall, 0.81% of EOC cases had a mutation in one of these three genes compared with 0.11% in controls. Our data suggest that both RAD51C and RAD51D are ovarian cancer susceptibility genes; however, RAD51B mutations are unlikely to contribute substantially to ovarian cancer risk.
Several other studies have reported on the prevalence of germline genetic variations in these genes (Appendix Table A5). However, for most of these, the ascertainment of cases was complex: several sequenced an affected proband (either breast or ovarian cancer) from a family with multiple cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer. Six studies sequenced RAD51C in ovarian cancer cases unselected for family history,34-39 but only one of these carried out equivalent sequencing of controls.34 Three studies sequenced RAD51D in unselected ovarian cancer cases,36,40,41 but none of these sequenced the whole gene in controls. In these studies, the mutation frequency in cases ranged from 0.4% to 1.1% for RAD51C and 0.8% to 1.1% for RAD51D.
In this study, the mutation frequency in cases unselected for family history was 0.32% for RAD51C and 0.35% in RAD51D. These are likely to be underestimates of the true mutation frequencies. Our next-generation sequencing approach enabled rapid and highthroughput analysis of candidate genes in thousands of samples but

did not provide complete coverage of all genes in all samples (mean coverage per sample, 90%). Also, we used polymerase chain reaction­ based enrichment of candidate gene coding regions; any deleterious mutations occurring outside these regions (eg, large genomic deletions and rearrangements) would not have been detected. Finally, we did not include missense variants in our prevalence estimates, because we could not be certain of their pathogenicity in the absence of definitive functional assays. However, burden tests for RAD51C and RAD51D variants indicate that rare missense variants that are predicted to disrupt protein function are significantly more prevalent in cases than controls, which suggests that at least a proportion of these variants is deleterious.
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common ovarian cancer subtype, and mutations were more prevalent in patients with HGSOC (1.1%) than in other subtypes (0.49%). This finding, perhaps, is expected, because deficiency of doublestrand DNA break repair by homologous recombination as a result of germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 also is associated with HGSOC.8,42
Although there are similarities in the functional mechanisms associated with the RAD51 genes and BRCA1/BRCA2, the genetic epidemiology suggests there are also differences. For example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations confer risks of both breast and ovarian cancer, but there is little evidence from other studies that RAD51C or RAD51D mutations confer increased risks of breast cancer. The location of truncating mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 is associated with variable risks of breast and ovarian cancer.43,44 All except two of the predicted truncating mutations identified in RAD51C were located between amino acid 143 and 319 in a functional domain in the C terminus of the protein (residues 79 to 376).45 This domain is important for forming the RAD51BRAD51C-RAD51D-XRCC2 and RAD51C-XRCC3 complexes. Likewise, all of the deleterious mutations identified in RAD51D were clustered in the C-terminal region (residues 77 to 328), which affects binding to RAD51C and likely impairs double-strand DNA break repair45 (Fig 1).
Our RR estimate for RAD51D is similar to that reported previously by Loveday et al20 (6.3; 95% CI, 2.9 to 14) on the basis of the analysis of families with multiple cases of ovarian cancer. Our RR estimate for RAD51C is similar to those reported by Pelttari et al35 (6.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 35) for unselected ovarian cancer. The wide CIs of risk estimates for both genes suggest that caution needs to be applied if the genes are used clinically for genetic risk prediction. In addition, the fact that 18% of ovarian cancers in women carrying RAD51C and

RAD51D mutations occurred at younger than 50 years (Table 4) suggests that, if risk estimates were confirmed, offering premenopausal women the option of RRSO should be considered. If clinical testing for RAD51C and RAD51D was approved, women could undergo panel testing for multiple susceptibility genes, and carriers, along with their relatives, could be offered RRSO.
In summary, we estimate that RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D are responsible for approximately one in every 90 high-grade serous EOC occurrences and one in every 120 EOC occurrences. In addition to the benefit of mutation testing of RAD51C and RAD51D for disease prevention, mutation carriers also may be responsive to treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, which results in synthetic lethality of cells that have mutant homologous recombination or double-strand DNA break repair. This treatment might improve progression-free survival among these patients. Hence, such testing may be useful in patient decision making.

GLOSSARY TERMS

allele: an alternative form of a gene (in diploids, one member
of a pair) that is located at a specific position on a specific chromosome.
missense mutation: a change (mutation) in one nucleotide
that results in the coding of a different amino acid.

penetrance: the likelihood that a given gene mutation will produce
disease. This likelihood is calculated by examining the proportion of people with the particular genetic mutation that show symptoms of disease.
