Genetic variants associated with breast-cancer risk: comprehensive research synopsis, meta-analysis, and epidemiological evidence

Ben Zhang, Alicia Beeghly-Fadiel, Jirong Long, Wei Zheng

Summary
Background More than 1000 reports have been published in the past two decades on associations between variants in candidate genes and risk of breast cancer. Results have been generally inconsistent. We did a literature search and meta-analyses to provide a synopsis of the current understanding of the genetic architecture of breast-cancer risk.
Methods A systematic literature search for candidate-gene association studies of breast-cancer risk was done in two stages, using PubMed on or before Feb 28, 2010. A total of 24 500 publications were identified, of which 1059 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Meta-analyses were done for 279 genetic variants in 128 candidate genes or chromosomal loci that had at least three data sources. Variants with significant associations by meta-analysis were assessed using the Venice criteria and scored as having strong, moderate, or weak cumulative evidence for an association with breast-cancer risk.
Findings 51 variants in 40 genes showed significant associations with breast-cancer risk. Cumulative epidemiological evidence of an association was graded as strong for ten variants in six genes (ATM, CASP8, CHEK2, CTLA4, NBN, and TP53), moderate for four variants in four genes (ATM, CYP19A1, TERT, and XRCC3), and weak for 37 variants. Additionally, in meta-analyses that included a minimum of 10 000 cases and 10 000 controls, convincing evidence of no association with breast-cancer risk was identified for 45 variants in 37 genes.
Interpretation Whereas most genetic variants assessed in previous candidate-gene studies showed no association with breast-cancer risk in meta-analyses, 14 variants in nine genes had moderate to strong evidence for an association. Further evaluation of these variants is warranted.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease caused by complex inherited and environmental factors.1 So far, genetic studies have identified and confirmed four rare highpenetrance genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PTEN), four rare moderate-penetrance genes (CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1, and PALB2), and around 20 common lowpenetrance variants in 19 genes or loci that contribute to a woman's risk of breast cancer (tables 1 and 2).2­12 Common genetic risk variants have mainly been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although the list in the tables 1 and 2 represents the culmination of our current understanding of the genetic architecture of breast cancer, these genes and loci are estimated to account for only 28% of the inherited causes of the disease.11
Despite the prominence and growing body of results from GWAS, candidate-gene association studies remain the most prevalent type of investigation to identify common breast-cancer susceptibility alleles. More than 1000 candidate-gene breast-cancer association studies have been published in the past two decades, which have evaluated more than 7000 genetic variants (webappendix p 1). Although some of these variants could have true associations with breast-cancer risk, many false-positive associations are identified that do not replicate in

additional study populations. Determining if associations are real has generally been done by examining all the epidemiological evidence in conjunction with biological plausibility, in the form of a meta-analysis. Previous meta-analyses mainly focused on one variant, or variants within one gene; however, recent meta-analyses have begun to increase in size and scope.13,14 Guidelines for the assessment of cumulative evidence for genetic associations, which have become known as the Venice criteria, have been set forth by the Human Genome Epidemiology Network Working Group.15,16
This study was undertaken in view of the plethora of candidate-gene association studies, the necessity for replication across studies to identify markers truly associated with disease risk,17­19 and the criteria provided to evaluate genetic associations with disease. We attempted to evaluate all candidate-gene association studies of breast cancer, perform meta-analyses for variants with sufficient data available, and provide a synopsis of our current understanding of the genetic architecture of breast-cancer risk.

All methods were based on guidelines proposed by the Human Genome Epidemiology Network for systematic

Study eligibility, criteria, and literature searches Studies were eligible to be included if they met the following criteria. First, publications must have been online or in peer-review journals and published in English on or before Feb 28, 2010. Second, the study design must be a case-control, cohort, or a cross-sectional association study in human beings. Third, breast-cancer cases must have been diagnosed by pathological or histological examination. Fourth, the study must have provided sufficient information such that the genotype frequencies for both breast-cancer cases and controls could be determined. High-penetrance germline muta-

tions in known breast-cancer susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, and TP53, were not included in this meta-analysis. Because GWAS-identified variants have been convincingly replicated by many studies, they also were not included in this meta-analysis.
To identify all relevant publications, we used a twostage search strategy (figure). First, PubMed was queried with the terms "breast cancer AND association" to find all studies published before Aug 31, 2009, that included associations with breast cancer. This search yielded 11 669 publications, which were screened by title and abstract, or a full-text review if necessary, to identify 799 publications that met our eligibility criteria; these publications included variants within 404 candidate genes or chromosomal loci. Second, targeted monthly searches of PubMed between Sept 1, 2009, and Feb 28, 2010, were done using the 404 candidate genes or chromosomal loci--eg, "SHBG" or "rs6259" in conjunction with "breast cancer" as query terms. General monthly searches between Sept 1, 2009, and Feb 28, 2010, were also done, using the term "breast cancer". Finally, the references of all included studies were screened, as were reference lists from reviews and meta-analyses. The PubMed related article option was used to search for additional potential publications. These three components of our second-stage search strategy identified a total of 12 831 publications, of which 260 met our eligibility criteria; these included variants within 117 additional candidate genes or chromosomal loci. Thus, 24 500 publications were screened by title, abstract, or full text if necessary, identifying a total of 1059 eligible publications that included 521 candidate genes or chromosomal regions and 2790 genetic variants.
Data extraction and preparation Data were extracted by one reviewer (BZ) and checked by a second reviewer (ABF). Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus. In the case of sequential or multiple publications of the same or overlapping data, only reports of results from the largest or most recent analysis were included. Publications with entirely redundant information were not included (n=57). If a report included several source or study populations, data was extracted separately if possible. Data extracted from each eligible publication included first author, year published, PubMed identifier number, study design, method of case selection, matching factors if applicable, source population, ethnicity of participants, inclusion criteria of cases and controls, mean ages of cases and controls, sample size, genes, variants, major and minor alleles, genotype counts for cases and controls, Hardy­ Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) among controls, genotyping methods used, whether these methods had been validated, and whether genotyping was done in a masked manner. Specifically, case selection was classified as population-based, hospital-based, or mixed. Ethnicity was classified as African, Asian (east Asian descent),

Caucasian (European descent), or other (including mixed) based on the ethnicity of at least 80% of the study population.22 If ethnicity was not reported, we considered the ethnicity of the source population based on the country where the study was done.22 The most current gene names and variant accession numbers were used, according to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases.23 For variants without accession numbers, the most commonly used name, such as nucleotide position (ie, 7271T>G) or protein residue (ie, Val2424Gly) was used. Minor and major alleles of variants among populations of specific ethnicities were determined according to the dbSNP database. Genetic variants from publications were checked for inversion of major and minor alleles; if the reported minor-allele frequency (MAF) was different from that in dbSNP by 20% or greater, the authors were contacted (n=7). Authors were also contacted if reported alleles differed from those in dbSNP (n=10). Responses were received and issues were resolved for six and seven publications, respectively, so these studies were included. Further, authors were contacted for 26 publications that were initially ineligible because of insufficient information for data extraction; responses were received for five queries, so these publications were included. Information on genes and variants from the 21 publications without sufficient information to be included in our meta-analyses is available in the webappendix (pp 6­16), Thus, 1059 eligible publications had sufficient data available for extraction and inclusion in meta-analyses.

Statistical analysis All statistical tests in this study were two-tailed and p values of 0·05 or less were considered significant, unless otherwise stated. Statistical analyses were done with Stata, version 11.0. For meta-analysis of any variant, a minimum of three data sources was required; this decision was made to stabilise the heterogeneity test statistic (I²), and to ensure that sensitivity analyses could be done. Eligible publications included a total of 2790 genetic variants, of which 279 had at least three data sources for meta-analysis. For common variants (MAF5%), effects associated with minor alleles were evaluated. Because major and minor alleles can be reversed in populations of different ethnicities, averaged MAFs across studies may be greater than 50%; when this occurred, the minor allele among Caucasians was used as the minor allele in all analyses. For copynumber variations (CNVs), mitochondrial (mtDNA) polymorphisms, and phenotype traits, the less prevalent variant or trait was evaluated for associated effects unless otherwise stated. HWE among control groups in each study was assessed by Fisher's exact test to compare observed and expected genotype frequencies.24 Estimates of association with cancer risk were evaluated by odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% CIs, using

the random-effects method of DerSimonian and Laird.25 For common genetic variants, allelic, dominant, and recessive models were computed; for rare variants, CNVs, mtDNA polymorphisms, and phenotype traits, only the appropriate dominant or recessive model was used, unless otherwise stated. Meta-analyses stratified by ethnicity were done if data permitted; a minimum of three data sources was required. To minimise falsenegative errors, for variants that showed no evidence of association with breast-cancer risk in meta-analyses, only those with a minimum of 10 000 cases and 10 000 controls were selected for presentation.
Evaluation of meta-analysis results included a test of heterogeneity, sensitivity analyses, and examination for bias. Heterogeneity between studies in meta-analyses was assessed by the Cochran Q statistic, and p values less than 0·10 indicated significant heterogeneity.26 We also used the I² statistic to quantify heterogeneity.27 Generally, I² values less than 25% correspond to mild heterogeneity, values between 25% and 50% correspond to moderate heterogeneity, and values greater than 50% correspond to large heterogeneity between studies. Sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness and examine the results of our meta-analyses for possible bias. For variants that had a significant association with

breast cancer in our meta-analyses, the first published or first positive report, defined as the earliest study to publish a significant association (p0·05), was excluded, then all small studies (<500 cases) were excluded, and finally, for common variants, all studies with control groups not in HWE (p0·05) were excluded. Potential publication bias was assessed with funnel plots of effect sizes versus standard errors; Begg's test was used to identify significant asymmetry.28 Bias due to results from small studies was evaluated by modified Egger tests, which correct for potential type I errors.29 An excess of significant findings was evaluated by the method of Ioannidis and Trikalinos30 for each individual metaanalysis, as well as for groups of meta-analyses, defined by significance of association with breast-cancer risk, degree of heterogeneity (large or not), or ethnicity (Caucasian, Asian, or other). p values less than 0·10 were considered significant in the modified Egger test and test for excess significant findings.
Assessment of cumulative evidence We applied the Venice criteria to all significant associations identified by meta-analysis, to evaluate the epidemiological credibility of each.15,16 Credibility was defined as strong, moderate, or weak, based on grades of A, B, or C in three categories: amount of evidence, replication of the association, and protection from bias.15,16 Amount of evidence was graded by the sum of test alleles or genotypes among cases and controls in the meta-analysis: a grade of A for more than 1000, B for 100­1000, and C for less than 100. Caution was taken when applying this criterion to very rare variants (MAF0·5%), since an A grade is unobtainable. Replication was graded by the heterogeneity statistic: A for I² less than 25%, B for I² between 25% and 50%, and C for I² over 50%. Protection from bias was graded as A if there was no observable bias and bias was unlikely to explain the presence of the association, B if bias could be present or could explain the presence of the association, or C if bias was evident or was likely to explain the presence of the association. Assessment of protection from bias also considered the magnitude of association; a score of C was assigned to an association with a summary OR less than 1·15, unless the association had been replicated prospectively by several studies with no evidence of publication bias. Thus, the cumulative epidemiological evidence for significant associations in meta-analyses were considered to be strong if all three grades were A, moderate if all three grades were A or B, and weak if any grades were C.
Role of the funding source The study sponsor had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to the data and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Results
A total of 1059 publications including 521 genes or chromosomal loci and 2790 variants were eligible to be included in our analysis (figure). Most of these reports (n=961, 91%) were published since 2000, with the highest number published in 2008 (n=154; webappendix p 1). The mean number of variants analysed per publication was consistently less than five until 2005, and then increased to a maximum of 15·6 in 2008. The median sample size of cases included in the 1059 publications was 461 (range 26­35 331) and the mean was 1037. The median sample size of controls was 503 (range 24­37 214) and the mean was 1261. Meta-analyses were done for 279 genetic variants (235 common and 44 rare) in 128 candidate genes or chromosomal loci that had a minimum of three data sources available (webappendix pp 2­5). The mean pooled sample size of the 279 metaanalyses was 14 952 (range 616­92 701); each metaanalysis included an mean of 8·6 independent studies (range 3­61). Common variants (MAF5%) included synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; n=14), non-synonymous SNPs (n=95), intronic or intragenic SNPs (n=33), SNPs in 5´ or 3´ untranslated regions (UTRs; n=68), mtDNA polymorphisms (n=9), short tandem repeats (STR) or microsatellite polymorphisms (n=10), CNVs (n=2), phenotypes (n=3), and one frameshift polymorphism. Rare variants (MAF<5%) included non-synonymous SNPs or mutations (n=27), truncating or splice-junction mutations (n=6), intronic or intragenic SNPs (n=3), SNPs in 5´or 3´UTRs (n=2), mtDNA polymorphisms (n=4), and one STR and CNV each.
29 variants within 20 genes (ATM, CASP8, CHEK2, CTLA4, CYP19A1, ERCC2, ESR1, GSTM1, GSTT1, HSD17B1, IFNG, IGF1, LRTOMT, MTHFR, NBN, NUMA1, TP53, TYMS, VDR, and WRN) had significant associations with breast-cancer risk by meta-analysis (table 3; webappendix pp 2­5). These meta-analyses included an mean of 13·2 studies (range 3­61) and 19 591 participants (range 721­92 701). Strong associations with breast-cancer risk (ORs greater than two) were seen for two rare truncating mutations (ATM Glu1978X and NBN 657del5), and for three rare variants in CHEK2 (IVS2+1G>A, a CNV deletion [5·4 kb], and 1100delC). Moderate associations with breast-cancer risk (ORs>1·5) were seen for three common variants, including non-synonymous polymorphisms in CHEK2 (rs17879961) and LRTOMT (rs673478) and a short tandem repeat in CYP19A1 ([TTTA]10). All four CHEK2 variants had associations with breastcancer risk at p<10­, as did two common non-synonymous SNPs (CASP8 rs1045485 and CTLA4 rs231775) and one deletion polymorphism (GSTM1). Significant associations with breast-cancer risk were also found for nine noncoding SNPs (CASP8 rs6435074 and rs6723097, ESR1 rs3020314, HSD17B1 rs676387, IFNG rs2430561, IGF1 rs6220, NUMA1 rs3018301, TP53 rs12947788 and rs12951053), five non-synonymous SNPs (ATM rs1800057,

ERCC2 rs13181, MTHFR rs1801133, VDR rs731236, and WRN rs1346044), one synonymous SNP (ESR1 rs1801132), one deletion (GSTT1), one insertion-deletion polymorphism (TP53 rs17878362), and one short tandem repeat (TYMS). Several meta-analyses included only one

ethnicity, since available data were limited to one ethnicity. 14 variants with significant associations with breast-cancer risk were studied only among Caucasian women, one significantly associated variant had data available only among Asian women.

Seven additional variants were significantly associated with breast-cancer risk in meta-analyses stratified by ethnicity (table 3). Among Caucasians, analyses were done for 206 variants and included an mean of 7·8 studies (range 3­38) and 15 987 participants (range 1194­81 172). Among Asians, analyses were done for 49 variants and included an mean of 5·0 studies (range 3­14) and 5688 participants (range 1370­14 901). Three common non-synonymous polymorphisms (AURKA rs1047972, MTR rs1805087, and NQO1 rs1800566) had evidence of associations with breastcancer risk among Caucasian women, but not among Asian women. Three common SNPs had associations with breast-cancer risk among Asian women, including two non-synonymous polymorphisms (GSTP1 rs1695 and XRCC3 rs861539) and one intronic variant (ESR1 rs2234693); there was no association with breast-cancer risk among Caucasian women. One non-coding variant (TNF rs1800629) had a significant protective effect only among Caucasian women, although the association did not seem to differ between Asian and Caucasian women. Instead, significance for this TNF variant seemed to be attenuated by including studies of ethnicities other than Asian or European ancestries (data not shown).
All genetic models of association shown in table 3 are from allelic contrasts, except where data did not permit, such as for rare variants. Among the 36 variants with a significant association with breast-cancer risk, there was sufficient data to evaluate 26 variants using dominant

and recessive models; the association was no longer significant for 11 and 10 variants, respectively. Although not significant in allelic contrasts, 15 additional common genetic variants had significant associations with breastcancer risk using either dominant or recessive geneticeffect models in meta-analyses (table 4). Of these, the association with the largest magnitude was for a nonsynonymous SNP (NCOA3 rs2230782), and the most significant association was for a non-coding variant (TERT rs2853669). No additional significant associations were found in ethnicity-specific analyses using either dominant or recessive genetic models.
Meta-analysis showed that there was no association with breast-cancer risk for 45 genetic variants in 37 genes (table 5). Variants were assessed in at least three studies, with a minimum of 10 000 cases and 10 000 controls, providing solid evidence for a null association. Although allelic associations are presented, no evidence of association with breast-cancer risk was seen for any of these variants in any model tested (allelic, dominant, and recessive).
Of the 279 meta-analyses of all available data (webappendix pp 2­5), 140 (50%) had little or no heterogeneity (I²<25%), 64 (23%) had moderate heterogeneity (25%I²50%), and 75 (27%) had high heterogeneity (I²>50%). The proportion of studies with high heterogeneity was significantly lower for the 29 variants in table 3 than for the remaining 250 variants (3% and 30%, respectively; Fisher's exact p value=0·003). Of the 225 ethnicity-specific meta-analyses, 111 (49%)

Sensitivity analyses were done for all 51 variants significantly associated with breast-cancer risk, first by excluding the first published or first positive report, then by excluding small studies (<500 cases). Sensitivity analyses were done for common variants by excluding studies in which control genotype distributions were not in HWE. When the first published or first positive report was excluded, the association for 30 variants was no longer significant. However, only six of these variants showed an OR alteration of more than 5% (allelic associations for IFNG rs2430561 and LTROMT rs63478, a dominant association for BARD1 rs1048108, and recessive associations for IL10 rs1800896, LEPR rs1137101, and NCOA3 rs2230782). When small studies were excluded, the significance of the association with breast-cancer risk was attenuated for 15 variants, but only five had a change of magnitude of more than 5% (allelic associations for ERCC2 rs13181 and TP53 rs17878362, and recessive associations for LEPR rs1137101, NCOA3 rs2230782, and XRCC1 rs25487). Sensitivity analyses that excluded small studies could not be done for seven variants (GNB3 rs5443, IFNG rs2430561, IL10 rs1800896, LRTOMT rs673478, MSH3 rs26279, NQO1 rs1800566, and NUMA1 rs3018301), because there were no studies of at least 500 cases in the meta-analysis. 19 meta-analyses that showed significant associations with breast-cancer risk included data with control genotype frequencies that deviated from HWE. Exclusion of these data sources resulted in diminished significance for three variants (GSTP1 rs1695, MTR rs1805087, and NUMA1 rs3018301 among Caucasians) but alteration of the magnitude of the association by more than 5% for only one variant (NUMA1 rs3018301).
Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Begg's tests; three variants showed evidence of possible publication bias (allelic association for ERCC2 rs13181 and TNF rs1800629 among Caucasians, and a recessive association for XRCC1 rs25487). Modified Egger tests were used to evaluate possible bias due to small studies. Evidence of more conservative results from larger studies than smaller studies was found for five variants among analyses done of all available data (CHEK2 CNV deletion and 1100delC, ERCC2 rs13181, GSTM1 deletion, and LRTOMT rs673478), two variants among Caucasians (NQO1 rs1800566 and TNF rs1800629), and dominant and recessive associations for BARD1 rs1048108 and XRCC1 rs25487, respectively. Notably, for both CHEK2 variants, removal of small studies did not substantially alter the results. Among all 279 meta-analyses, 42 had evidence of excess studies with significant findings, of which only one was in the group of variants with very small significant summary ORs for breast-cancer risk (MTHFR rs1801133). When grouped by variants with or without nominally significant associations, evidence of excess studies with significant findings was seen only among those without nominally significant summary ORs (p<10­). Alternately, evidence for excess studies with significant findings was found for all meta-analyses

groups defined by either heterogeneity or ethnicity. Further, when evaluating all studies included in our meta-analyses as a whole, the number of studies with significant findings greatly exceeded the number expected (p<10­), suggesting the presence of biases in published candidate-gene association studies.
In our assessment of the cumulative epidemiological evidence for significant meta-analysis associations (tables 3 and 4), evidence was graded as strong (A), moderate (B), or weak (C) for the total amount of evidence, replication of the association, and protection against bias, as specified by the Venice criteria.15,16 Of the 51 variants with significant associations with breast-cancer risk (p0·05), grades of A were given to 32, 43, and 14 variants for the amount of evidence, replication of the association, and protection from bias, respectively. Grades of B were given to 13, four, and zero variants for these three respective criteria. Grades of C were given to 37 variants for protection from bias, mainly because of the loss of significance after excluding the first study (n=30), and a small effect with breast-cancer risk (OR<1·15, n=26). Grades of C for protection from bias were also given for variants with meta-analyses that showed smaller studies having larger effects than larger studies (n=7), a loss of significance when studies with controls not in HWE were excluded (n=3), significant Begg's test indicating publication bias (n=3), and an excess of significant findings (n=1); these reasons were not exclusive. Only one variant received a C grade for amount of evidence, and four for replication of the association. Ten variants received A grades for all three criteria and can therefore be regarded as having strong cumulative epidemiological evidence of an association with breast-cancer risk; these include ATM Glu1978X, CASP8 rs1045485 and rs6723097, CHEK2 IVS2+1G>A, rs17879961, 5·4 kb deletion, and 1100delC, CTLA4 rs231775, NBN 657del5, and TP53 rs17878362. Four variants received a grade of either A or B in all three criteria, and were thus scored as having moderate evidence of an association, including ATM rs1800057, a short tandem repeat in CYP19A1, a recessive effect for TERT rs2853669, and an allelic association among Asian women for XRCC3 rs861539. The remaining variants received a C grade in one or more criteria, and so despite an overall significant association with breastcancer risk by meta-analysis, were scored as having weak cumulative evidence of an association based on the Venice criteria. As proposed by the Human Genome Epidemiology Network,16 a few exceptions in scoring of the Venice criteria were made. One variant (CASP8 rs1045485) was not penalised for its small summary effect (OR<1·15), since it showed a very consistent association across studies that were specifically designed to evaluate it. Additionally, five variants (ATM Glu1978X; CHEK2 IVS2+1G>A, 5·4 kb deletion, and 1100delC; and NBN 657del5) were not scored for the amount of evidence because of their very low frequency in the population (<0·5%).

Discussion
This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive assessment of literature on the genetic architecture of breast-cancer susceptibility done so far. Using methods based on the guidelines for systematic reviews of genetic-association studies, proposed by the Human Genome Epidemiology Network,15,16,20,21 we did a comprehensive research synopsis and meta-analysis of genetic variants and breast-cancer risk. Significant associations with breastcancer risk were found for 51 variants, including 14 that showed moderate to strong cumulative epidemiological evidence for a true association. Additionally, metaanalyses with very large sample sizes (20 000 participants minimum), provided convincing evidence of no association with breast-cancer risk for 45 variants in 37 genes.
Strong cumulative evidence for an association with breast cancer was found for six rare variants; four of which are in the tumour suppressor CHEK2 gene, which initiates DNA repair after double-strand breaks.31­33 The four CHEK2 variants with strong evidence include the 1100delC truncating mutation at codon 381 in exon 10, a non-synonymous polymorphism in exon 3 (Ile157Thr, rs17879961), a truncating mutation in exon 3 (IVS2+IG>A), and a 5·4 kb deletion that includes exons 9 and 10. 1100delC, IVS2+IG>A, and the 5·4 kb deletion have kinase-deficient molecules because of protein truncations, whereas the minor allele of SNP Ile157Thr results in a CHEK2 protein with normal kinase activity but with deficient binding and phosphorylation of downstream substrates.31­35 The increased risks of breast cancer associated with these variants ranged from OR 1·52 (95% CI 1·31­1·77) for Ile157Thr (rs17879961), to OR 3·10 (2·59­3·71) for 1100delC; the association with breast cancer for this variant is well established. The CHEK2 5·4 kb deletion is the first low-penetrance, large deletion variation to be confirmed to have a highly significant association with breast-cancer risk specifically in Caucasian women from eastern Europe.36­38
Our meta-analyses revealed two additional rare variants with strong evidence of association with breast-cancer risk. A rare truncating variant (Glu1978X) in the ATM gene was associated with a large increase in breast-cancer risk, in a meta-analysis of four studies of Caucasian women (OR 4·56, 95% CI 1·35­15·42). The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase involved in monitoring and repair of double-strand DNA.39,40 A rare 5 bp deletion in exon 6 (657del5) of the NBN gene (previously known as NBS1) showed a significant association with breastcancer risk (OR 2·42, 1·54­3·80) based on seven studies among Caucasians. The NBN gene encodes nibrin, a member of the MRE11-RAD50 double-strand break repair complex involved in cell-cycle checkpoint regulation;41 the rare deletion results in a truncated protein without full functionality.

Two of the four common SNPs that showed strong cumulative evidence for an association with breast-cancer risk are located in the CASP8 gene (also known as FLICE and MCH5, 2q33­q34), which is a member of the cysteine-aspartic acid protease family and has an important role in apoptosis.42 A nonsynonymous SNP, Asp302His (rs1045485) in exon 9, was first reported to be associated with breast-cancer risk by a large-scale candidate-gene association consortium analysis.43 Our meta-analysis of 17 data sources shows a significant protective effect associated with the minor allele of this polymorphism (OR 0·89, 95% CI 0·85­0·93). This locus is not polymorphic among Asians, so the association is limited to Caucasians.43 Our meta-analysis also revealed strong evidence of an association with breast-cancer risk for a second variant in the CASP8 gene, an intronic SNP (rs6723097) that is located about 21 kb away from Asp302His. These two SNPs are in very weak linkage disequilibrium (r²=0·153 among Caucasians based on HapMap LD release 27),23 therefore these two variants might be independently associated with breast-cancer risk. rs6723097 is in high linkage disequilibrium with rs6435074, another CASP8 variant that had weak cumulative evidence for an association with breast-cancer risk.
Two additional common variants that showed strong cumulative evidence for associations with breast cancer in meta-analyses were located in the CTLA4 (also known as CD152) and TP53 genes. The CTLA4 variant, an exon 1 non-synonymous SNP (rs231775), was associated with a moderate increase in breast-cancer risk (OR 1·25, 95% CI 1·14­1·37) by meta-analysis of three studies in Asian women. The variant results in a threonine to alanine substitution in the leader sequence of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), which transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells and is thought to affect carcinogenesis via antitumour immunity.44 The SNP is thought to enhance the inhibitory effect of CTLA4 on T-cell activation.45­47 This variant has also been associated with other cancer sites, including oesophageal and lung cancer among Asians;45 no studies have assessed this SNP and breast-cancer risk in Caucasians. Finally, although rare germline mutations in the tumour suppressor TP53 have been identified as high-penetrance breast-cancer susceptibility alleles,48 in the current analyses, a common 16 bp insertion-deletion variant (rs17878362) in intron 3 showed strong evidence of a small effect on breast-cancer risk. Women with the deletion were more likely to have breast cancer (OR 1·15, 1·04­1·26), based on our meta-analysis of 12 studies. This association is supported by functional evidence that decreased levels of TP53 mRNA were also associated with the deletion,49 and TP53 is essential for initiating apoptosis or senescence in response to DNA damage.50
Ethnicity-specific associations identified by metaanalysis included variants that only had data available among women of one ethnicity, and variants with

significant associations only in ethnicity-stratified analyses. A greater number of significant associations with candidate genes were identified among European women than other ethnicities, mainly because most studies have been done in Europeans. Ethnicity-specific disease associations might arise from differences in genetic linkage-disequilibrium structure across populations, or because of other unknown environmental or genetic contributors. Additional evaluation of these variants among women of different ethnic populations is warranted. In addition to the ten variants that had strong cumulative evidence of an association with breast-cancer risk, four had moderate evidence, including rare variants in ATM and CYP19A1, a common polymorphism with a recessive effect in TERT, and a common non-synonymous SNP in XRCC3 among Asian women. Additional investigation of these four variants is also warranted.
In addition to identifying variants significantly associated with breast-cancer risk, a goal of meta-analysis is to reveal, to a high degree of certainty, genetic variants that show no evidence of an association. 45 variants in 37 genes were not associated with breast-cancer risk, in meta-analyses with a minimum of 20 000 patients. These meta-analyses had greater than 93% power to detect additive associations of 1·10 for variants with MAFs of 15%, and 97% power for MAFs of 20%. Therefore, continued assessment of the main effects of these variants in epidemiological studies with a similar sample size is unlikely to be helpful.
Limitations of this research synopsis must be addressed. Although an exhaustive literature search was done, it is likely that some publications were overlooked. Reports in languages other than English were not included, and publications without resolvable genotype counts could not be incorporated. However, these types of reports probably represent a small percentage of all studies investigating breast-cancer associated variants, and their inclusion should not alter the overall results of this largescale meta-analysis. Analyses were done only for variants with a minimum of three data sources. Genotype counts and crude estimates of effect were used, rather than adjusted estimates of association. Further, we did not assess gene­gene or gene­environment interactions. Finding concordance in definitions of exposure variables and use of covariates across studies is challenging, and so these interaction analyses were beyond the scope of the current report; additional investigation is needed. Heterogeneity was common in the 279 meta-analyses in this study. Although we could remove some variability with ethnicity-specific analyses, other sources of heterogeneity were not examined, such as tumour types or oestrogen-receptor status. Most studies do not report associations by subtypes of breast cancer; future research is needed. Multiple comparisons are another possible concern. We did a total of 982 meta-analyses, including genetic-effect models and ethnicity-specific analyses; a Bonferoni corrected p value threshold for significance

would be 5×10­. Five variants with strong epidemiological evidence have p values higher than this threshold. However, this p value is overly conservative, since many of the tests were not independent. Further, we sought to summarise and evaluate existing associations, rather than to identify new associations. Using a p value significance threshold of 0·05 reduced the possibility of type II errors. Most importantly, variants with significant associations with breast cancer were graded as having strong, moderate, or weak cumulative evidence based on the Venice criteria,15,16 so results should not be interpreted by p value alone (eight of the ten variants with strong epidemiological evidence had p values 10­). Finally, we found that the Venice criteria were more suitable for common variants than rare variants. To earn an A grade for amount of evidence, a variant with a MAF of 0·5% would require at least 100 000 study participants; no meta-analyses done so far have been that large. Therefore, we propose amendments for the Venice criteria to include a minimum of three homogeneous sources, a more stringent p value, the incorporation of biological evidence, and consideration of the MAF.
New large studies and meta-analyses of existing studies are needed to identify disease-associated genetic variants. The consistency of the association, a main criterion for evaluating causality in epidemiological studies, can not be readily assessed in a single study, particularly a study of a single population. Differences in genetic architecture across ethnic groups mean that variants might be associated with disease risk in one population but not in others. Further, a variant might show heterogeneity of effect by ethnicity because of gene­gene and gene­ environment interactions, and so research among different populations is needed to uncover these differences. Meta-analyses can suffer from publication bias and can be limited by data available from published studies done using different protocols. Nevertheless, meta-analyses are an important method to evaluate the consistency of study findings, assess cumulative evidence from previous studies, and provide clues and guidelines for future studies.
It has been 20 years since the mapping of the breastovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 to chromosome 17.51 Recent GWAS have provided strong evidence for 19 common loci as breast-cancer susceptibility variants.2­12 These common loci, along with germline mutations in BRCA1 and other known breastcancer susceptibility genes, explain only 28% of the heritability of the disease.11 Most GWAS have been done among women of European ancestries; future studies in other populations are likely to identify additional variants. Increased coverage of genetic variation in new SNP arrays used in GWAS is also likely to identify additional breast-cancer susceptibility variants. Although GWAS are a powerful means to uncover common genetic variants for breast cancer and other complex diseases, candidate-gene studies remain useful to test a-priori

hypotheses and confirm associations with breast-cancer risk for variants selected based on strong biological evidence. In this large-scale, comprehensive metaanalysis, we identified 14 genetic variants that showed strong or moderate evidence of associations with breastcancer risk; further investigation of these variants is warranted. All ten variants with strong cumulative epidemiological evidence retained significance for an association regardless of genetic model used, and eight of ten have functional data in the literature supporting a role in breast-cancer susceptibility. We also identified 45 variants in 37 genes that convincingly showed no evidence of association with breast-cancer risk. Our meta-analyses summarise current literature on the genetic architecture of breast-cancer susceptibility, and provide useful data for designing future studies to assess genetic factors for breast-cancer risk.
