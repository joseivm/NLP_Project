Abstract
 TP53 is the mostly commonly mutated gene in many cancers and the P53 tumor suppressor protein is involved in multiple cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair, genomic stability, senescence, cell cycle control and apoptosis. A common single nucleotide polymorphism located within the proline rich region of TP53 gene at codon 72 in exon 4 encodes either proline or arginine. TP53 Arg 72 is more active than TP53 Pro 72 in inducing apoptosis. The aim of this study was to understand the association of the 72 codon polymorphism with acute leukemia development and prognosis. A total of 288 acute leukemia cases comprising 147 acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 141 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as 245 controls were recruited for analysis of the TP53 72 polymorphism using PCR-RFLP method. Significant association of homozygous arginine genotype with AML was observed (2- 133.53; df-2, p < 0.001. When data were analyzed with respect to clinical variables, elevation in mean WBC, blast %, LDH levels and slight reduction in DFS in ALL cases with the arginine genotype was observed. In contrast, AML patients with Pro/Pro had elevated WBC, Blast%, LDH levels with slightly reduced DFS. Our study indicates that Arg/Arg genotype might confer increased risk to development of acute myeloid leukemia.

Introduction
 The human TP53 gene is located on short arm of chromosome 17p13, encompassing 20 kilo bases (Kb) of DNA comprising of 11 exons. It encodes for 1.53KDa nuclear phosphoprotein composed of 393 amino acids, highly conserved in diverse organisms. It is a tumor suppressor gene and frequently mutated in most of the cancers (Hollstein et al., 1996). The TP53 protein is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a wide variety of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic or cellular stress (Donehower et al., 1993; Ko and Prives 1996). Growth arrest or cell death prevents damaged DNA from being replicated suggesting important role played by TP53 in maintaining the integrity of the genome (Lane et al., 1992). This activity is central to its role as a tumor suppressor and also of major importance in the response of many cancers to conventional therapies which trigger apoptosis by damaging DNA. Inactivation of TP53 through deletion, mutation or interaction with cellular or viral proteins is a key step in the development of over half of all human cancers (Nigro et al., 1987; Hollstein et al., 1996).  There is growing evidence that TP53 also exerts its influence on multiple aspects of tumor development including suppression of metastasis and inhibition of angiogenesis. The TP53 protein had been shown to limit

angiogenesis by at least three mechanisms: Interfering with central regulators of hypoxia that mediate angiogenesis, inhibiting production of proangiogenic factors and directly increasing the production of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors. The combination of these effects allows TP53 to efficiently shut down the angiogenic potential of cancer cells. Inactivation of TP53 which occur in approximately 50% of malignant tumors reverses these effects, as a consequence of which, tumors carrying TP53 mutation appear more visualized, more aggressive and exhibit poor prognosis. Thus, the loss of functional TP53 during tumorogenesis likely to represent an essential step in the switch to an angiogenic phenotype that was displayed by aggressive tumors (Teodoro et al., 2007).  Several polymorphisms have been identified within TP53 gene, both in non-coding and coding regions (Olivier et al., 2002). The Codon 72 of the TP53 gene harbor a well known polymorphic site either with Arg or Pro in the hydrophobic midsection of the TP53 protein. The two polymorphic forms (Pro72 and Arg72) of TP53 gene have different primary structures and electrophoretic migration properties (Sreeja et al., 2008) with different biochemical and biological potentials including binding to transcriptional machinery and activation of transcription, but they do not differ in their property to bind DNA (Thomas et al., 1999; Dumont et al., 2003). This polymorphism had been shown to exhibit

Beckman et al., 1994). It had been reported that the P53 Polymorphism in Acute Leukemia and Controls

Arg homozygous genotype could be a potential genetic risk factor for cancer. Initial studies had reported an association of codon 72 Arg/Arg and 7 fold increased risk of HPV associated cervical cancer. Invitro studies had indicated that HPVE6 oncoprotein targets readily the arginine form opposed to proline form of TP53 for degradation (Crook et al., 1996).  The arginine (Arg 72) allele increases the ability of p53 to locate to mitochondria and induce cellular death, whereas proline allele (Pro 72) exhibits a lower apoptotic potential and an increased cellular arrest in G1 of the cell cycle (Bergamaschi et al., 2006).

A common polymorphism in TP53 gene, unique to humans is located within the proline rich region of TP53 gene at codon 72 in exon 4 and encodes protein either with proline or arginine. The proline at residue 72 of TP53 is part of PXXP motif that is known to be critical in containing the tyrosine residue of SH3 domain-containing proteins. TP53 Arg 72 is more active than TP53 Pro 72 at inducing apoptosis due to varied tendency of protein localization in mitochondria. The mutation frequency in TP53 gene with Arg 72 allele is higher than the protein with
