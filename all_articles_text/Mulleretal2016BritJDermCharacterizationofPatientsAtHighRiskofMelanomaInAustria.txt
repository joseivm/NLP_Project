Background Risk of melanoma is determined by genetic and exogenous factors. Only a few studies have included both characteristics in a comprehensive multivariable analysis. Objectives To find determinants of patients at high risk of melanoma in Austria, including phenotype, genotype and lifestyle characteristics in comprehensive analyses. Methods In total, 1668 patients with melanoma from the M3 case­control study were studied. Overall, 567 participants were sequenced for CDKN2A, 232 for CDK4, 123 for MITF encoding the variant E318K and 964 for MC1R. Results Patients with melanoma with a positive family history (n = 190, 11Á6%), multiple primary melanomas (n = 261, 15Á7%) and younger age (< 50 years, n = 675, 40Á5%) were defined as being at high risk. All other patients with melanoma were defined as the reference group. We found significant differences between those two groups and between the high-risk subgroups (positive family history, multiple primary melanomas and younger age). Pigmentation phenotype was associated with the high-risk group in general (childhood freckling, odds ratio 1Á46, P = 0Á007; blond/reddish hair colour, odds ratio 1Á43, P = 0Á011). Patients with a positive family history and patients with early-onset disease were similar regarding both their phenotypic characteristics and external factors. Established high-risk mutations in CDKN2A were found in cases with a positive family history (n = 12) or multiple melanomas (n = 2). Moreover, we found three patients carrying the MITF p.E318K variant, two with a CDK4 variant and seven with nonsynonymous MC1R variants with undescribed biological significance, of which four were predicted as damaging. Conclusions Austrian patients could represent a reservoir for novel genetic variants. Further investigation of populations in Central and Eastern Europe might reveal more novel and disease-relevant variants.

What does this study add?
· This is the first comprehensive description of Austrian patients at high risk of melanoma.
· The heterogeneity of the different subgroups suggests diverse pathways. · We present functional prediction of MC1R and CDK4 variants with unknown biolog-
ical significance in high-risk patients, and three novel cases with MITF variants in high-risk patients.
What is the translational message?
· Identification of high-risk individuals helps to reduce mortality. · The risk of melanoma is comprised of a complex interplay between genetic and
environmental factors; however, genetic mutations associated with melanoma might differ from country to country.
· Knowledge of these mutations and adjustment of criteria for testing could be required for adequate risk assessments.

Melanoma is still one of the most life-threatening types of cancer, with an increasing number of incident cases worldwide.1 Exact knowledge of its cause is the basis for disease prevention, particularly for those at high risk. The risk is determined by a complex interplay of external and genetic factors. In specialized centres, genetic testing is suggested for patients who are regarded as being at high risk.2 CDKN2A is the best-described high-risk melanoma gene, followed by CDK4, which has been described in only a few families worldwide. Additionally, numerous low-risk variants in MC1R modulate the risk, in addition to high-risk mutations. Furthermore, variations in other genes such as MITF and POT1 have been described as being associated with familial melanoma.
In spite of numerous studies describing phenotypic features or genetic factors separately, there are only a few studies where risk factors were analysed comprehensively.3,4 Here we present for the first time a comprehensive study of established genetic variants and phenotypic and lifestyle characteristics associated with melanoma in a central European population, to improve the knowledge of determinants of patients at high risk of melanoma and the different subgroups.
Patients and methods
Patients
All 1668 histologically confirmed patients with melanoma who were recruited from 2008 to 2015 as part of the M3 case­control study were included.5,6 The participants originated mainly from Vienna, the province of Lower Austria, and Burgenland (Table S1; see Supporting Information). To address a potential selection bias, patients were included from different Austrian hospitals. The data were collected by blood

draw and a questionnaire, as described elsewhere.5 Those with an unavailable pathology report or occult melanoma were not included in this study.
We categorized cases as high risk when they fulfilled at least one of the following criteria: (i) a positive family history (n = 190); (ii) multiple primary melanomas (n = 261); and (iii) early onset of melanoma (n = 675) (Table 1). All three criteria used for the categorization of high-risk patients were based on the signs for high-risk melanoma genes according to the Genomel Consortium.7 Other patients with one primary melanoma (n = 764), without a positive family history and aged > 50 years at diagnosis were used as the reference group. All of the comparative analyses were performed using the reference group.
The following patient characteristics were analysed: age at diagnosis, sex, skin reaction to sun exposure, hair and eye colour, childhood freckling, outdoor occupation, solarium use,

suncream use, weeks of holiday in the lifetime, number of sunburns from birth to age 10 years, time spent outdoors at leisure, localization of the primaries, tumour thickness according to Breslow, sentinel lymph node status, distant metastasis and MC1R gene status. In case of multiple primaries, melanoma-specific data always refers to the first primary melanoma.
Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna.
Statistics
In the univariable analysis nominal variables were analysed using a v2-test. The continuous variables, represented by mean values and their SDs, were analysed with an independent-sample t-test. High-risk patients and all subgroups were compared with patients with sporadic melanoma. All variables had been adjusted for sex and age in a multivariable analysis, except for the patients with early-onset melanoma. For this subgroup all significant variables of the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable model. All statistical tests were two sided with a significance level of a = 0Á05 and a 95% confidence interval (CI), and were performed using SPSS version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY, U.S.A.).
Genotyping
Sequencing data were available for CDKN2A from 474 participants, for exon 2 of CDK4 from 109 patients and for MC1R from 875 participants, as described previously.6,8 Additionally, 93 new cases were sequenced for CDKN2A, 123 for CDK4 and MITF, and 89 for MC1R. MC1R was analysed in all cases of melanoma (964 in total) as part of an association study.6 Among those 964 patients genotyped for MC1R, 452 high-risk patients and 115 cases of sporadic melanoma were sequenced for CDKN2A. CDK4 and MITF were sequenced in high-risk patients only.
MC1R variants were classified as variants strongly associated with red hair colour (R), including p.D84E, p.R142H, p.R151C, p.R160W and p.D294H, and variants weakly associated (r), including p.V60L, p.V92M and p.R163Q. The specific sequencing protocols and primers are described in the Supplementary Methods and Table S2 (see Supporting Information).
Prediction analysis
The nonsynonymous MC1R variants and the two CDK4 variants have been predicted with different prediction tools, as described before:8 MutationTaster2,9 PolyPhen-2 (Polymorphism Phenotyping-v2, HumDiv and HumVar),10 PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer),11 SIFT (sorts intolerant from tolerant substitutions),12 SNAP2 (screening for non-acceptable polymorphisms-2),13 Panther,14 GERP++,15 phyloP16 and CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion).17 For MC1R the

Ensembl transcript ID ENST00000555147 was used, and for CDK4 ENST00000257904 was used.
Results
Firstly, all characteristics of high-risk patients with melanoma (n = 904) were compared against the reference group (n = 764), as shown in Tables 2 and 3. After adjusting for sex and age, childhood freckling [odds ratio (OR) 1Á46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1Á11­1Á93, P = 0Á007] blond/reddish hair colour (OR 1Á43, 95% CI 1Á09­1Á88, P = 0Á011) and male sex (OR 1Á40, 95% CI 1Á07­1Á82, P = 0Á013) were associated with high-risk status (Table 2). Melanomas in the highrisk group were less likely to be localized on the head and neck compared with the reference group (P = 0Á005, Table 2). The tumour thickness was lower in high-risk patients (mean 1Á2 vs. 1Á8 mm, P = 0Á001); however, this failed to remain significant in the multivariable model (OR 0Á94, 95% CI 0Á87­1Á02, P = 0Á12). In total, 11Á4% (n = 190) of all patients with melanoma had at least one reported melanoma diagnosis in the family, 15Á7% (n = 261) had multiple primary melanomas and 40Á5% (n = 719) were diagnosed before the age of 50 years. All of the results of the univariable analysis are shown in Table 3.
We then studied the phenotypic differences between the subgroups of high-risk patients (Table 4). In the multivariable model, blond/reddish hair colour (OR 2Á05, 95% CI 1Á39­ 3Á04, P < 0Á001), childhood freckling (OR 1Á62, 95% CI 1Á10­2Á38, P = 0Á015) and sunburns aged 0­10 years (OR 1Á01, 95% CI 1Á00­1Á03, P = 0Á044) were significantly associated with positive family history. Male sex (OR 1Á75, 95% 95% CI 1Á26­2Á41, P = 0Á001) was significantly associated with multiple primary melanomas. Suncream use (OR 2Á52, 95% CI 1Á79­3Á53, P < 0Á001), solarium use (OR 2Á11, 95% CI 1Á47­3Á02, P < 0Á001), childhood freckling (OR 1Á73, 95% CI 1Á28­2Á33, P < 0Á001), Breslow index (OR 0Á89, 95% CI 0Á81­0Á98, P = 0Á013), outdoor occupation (OR 0Á64, 95% CI 0Á47­0Á87, P = 0Á005) and localization (head and neck as the reference, P = 0Á006 for extremities and P = 0Á019 for trunk) were significantly associated with earlyonset melanoma (Table 4).
Regarding genetic mutations, 14 patients (2Á5%) carried a disease-causing mutation in CDKN2A. This included 12 of 155 cases (7Á7%) with a positive family history who were tested for CDKN2A. The following established high-risk mutations were found in this study group: p.R24H (11 carriers; two carriers were shared in two families each and cosegregated with melanoma), p.N71T (one carrier), p.G101W (one carrier) and p.V126D (one carrier). Among the CDKN2A high-risk mutation carriers, 12 had another member in the pedigree with melanoma: nine cases were from a family with two cases, two carriers had three further cases, and one carrier had four cases in the pedigree (Table S3; see Supporting Information). In addition to the previously reported cases,8 we found four more participants with the p.A148T mutation, one with the c.150+ 37G>GC variant and one more patient

each carrying the p.R24P, p.A34V and p.P81R mutations. We also found a patient with a novel synonymous variant p.T93T. No high-risk mutations were found in the reference group.
Sequencing of CDK4 revealed two variants that had not been described in association with melanoma before. One variant (c.À60C>CG) was located in the 5-untranslated region. The carrier was a 20-year-old male patient diagnosed with a spitzoid melanoma with a tumour thickness of 1Á1 mm. The other variant, p.V154L, was located in exon 4, a protein-coding region. This female patient had a positive family history (father) and a melanoma with 0Á8mm Breslow thickness, excised at the age of 42 years. No further CDK4 mutations, including the known high-risk variants, were found. The p.E318K-causing variant of the MITF gene was detected in three cases, all from the high-risk group (2Á4% of 123 tested participants). High-risk patients more frequently carried red hair MC1R variants (R or r)

compared with the reference group (81Á3% vs. 74Á7%, P = 0Á023). When the subgroups were analysed separately, patients with a positive family history had the highest number of MC1R carriers (86Á2% vs. 74Á7%, P = 0Á022). The most frequent red hair variants were p.R160W for R and p.V60L for r.
High-risk patients carrying a disease-causing CDKN2A mutation were significantly younger at first melanoma diagnosis (mean 37 years vs. 47 years, P = 0Á019) and were more likely to be female (71% vs. 44Á1%, P = 0Á044) than high-risk wildtype patients in a univariable analysis (Table 5). They had more multiple primary melanomas (mean 2Á6 vs. 1Á7, P = 0Á005) and were more likely to have another family member with melanoma (mean 1Á1 vs. 0Á4, P < 0Á001), which remained significant after adjustment for age and sex: multiple primary melanoma count, OR 1Á64 (95% CI 1Á23­ 2Á20, P = 0Á001) and mean family members with melanoma, OR 3Á81 (95% CI 1Á98­7Á32, P < 0Á001).

In total, 46 different MC1R variants were found in all participants (Table S4; see Supporting Information). We found seven nonsynonymous variants in MC1R and two variants of CDK4, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been tested with prediction tools before.18­20 For those variants with unknown biological significance, 10 different prediction tools were applied to estimate their effect. For MC1R, the variant p.Y143C was found in three unrelated patients with melanoma, while the others occurred in only one person each. The prediction scores are listed in Table 6. Four variants (p.C35F, p.Y143C, p.A240T and p.I287N) were predicted to be damaging in > 75% of the used prediction tools. All carriers were classified as high risk, except for one patient carrying p.Y143C (for all phenotype data, see Table S5 in Supporting Information). The CDK4 variant p.V154L was classified as being deleterious by five prediction tools. The other, c.À60 C>CG, was located in a noncoding region and could therefore be predicted with only four tools; one predicted it to be diseasecausing.
Discussion
Individuals at high risk of melanoma should be recommended a more stringent skin examination for early recognition and risk-avoiding behaviour.21 As there are different characteristics that define someone as high risk, a more precise description of each subgroup might lead to preventive measures that are better adjusted to individual needs. In this study, we could reveal distinct differences not only between the high-risk and the reference groups, but also between each subgroup. For example, patients with a positive family history were younger on average than the entire study population (49 years, vs. 53 years for the high-risk and reference groups taken together), confirming increased inherited risk. However, positive family history was also associated with childhood freckling and red hair phenotype in a multivariable analysis. These findings support the hypothesis that high-risk individuals were at increased risk due to genetic susceptibility, as both onset of the disease and pigmentation phenotype are genetically determined. Interestingly, melanomas in this group were thinner than in the reference group, which might indicate

that knowledge of disease in the family leads to increased awareness and consequently to earlier consultation of a physician.
There are no indications for a slower growth of melanomas in patients with a positive family history, either in the literature or in our own study.22 Patients with multiple melanomas were slightly older than patients with a positive family history. After adjustment for age and sex only male sex remained significant as a risk factor compared with the reference group. For patients with early-onset melanoma, similar to the subgroup with a positive family history, both childhood freckling and external factors (solarium use and outdoor occupation) remained significant in a multivariable analysis. The lower numbers of melanomas in the head and neck region in the early-onset subgroup suggest that sun protection during vacation might reduce melanoma risk in addition to general awareness and avoidance of unnecessary ultraviolet exposure.23,24
Besides these clinical and phenotypic differences, we noticed genetic differences between the subgroups as well. For example, disease-related CDKN2A mutations (and functional MC1R variants) were found mostly in association with a positive family history (12 of 14 carriers, 86%). Therefore, genetic testing seems to be particularly effective in this group. Carriers of high-risk mutations in CDKN2A were more likely to have multiple primary melanomas and were younger. Of the 46 MC1R variants in this population seven have not been analysed with prediction tools before. Four of them were classified as deleterious by  75% of the prediction tools. All of those variants predicted to be deleterious were found in the highrisk group. As shown above, both CDK4 variants were predicted to be damaging. For the MITF p.E318K variant, we added three new carriers to the cases described previously in the literature, all in the high-risk group. The frequency of the MITF variant in our samples (2Á4%) was similar to that in previously reported studies, with a frequency of 1Á7­1Á8%.25,26 Although this variant is known to be associated with renal cell carcinoma, no such case was reported in either our patients or their families.
The study was limited by the anamnestic assessment of the family history. Therefore the actual number of cases of familial melanoma might be underestimated.

Patients at high risk of melanoma in Austria, C. Muller et al. 1317

To the best of our knowledge, for the first time all established familial melanoma risk genes were assessed combined with exogenous factors in the same patients. In our study, risk in early-onset patients appeared to be determined by environmental factors. The others cases seem to be determined mainly by genetic or other unassessed factors. Sun protection at an early age, particularly during recreational activities, might have prevented melanomas in the early-onset subgroup.
For the genetic analysis, the majority of disease-related CDKN2A mutation carriers would have been missed in our study if we had tested families with a minimum of three cases. Therefore, our study supports the current recommendation to offer testing to families with two or more affected members.7 We also revealed new nonsynonymous variants in CDK4 and MC1R associated with high-risk patients. Further studies in central and eastern European countries might reveal novel disease-relevant genetic variants.
