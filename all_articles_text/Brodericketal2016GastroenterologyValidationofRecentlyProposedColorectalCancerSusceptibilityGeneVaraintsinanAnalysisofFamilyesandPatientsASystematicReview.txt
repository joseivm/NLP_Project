ABSTRACT

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

Broderick et al

High-throughput sequencing analysis has accelerated searches for genes associated with risk for colorectal cancer (CRC); germline mutations in NTHL1, RPS20, FANCM, FAN1, TP53, BUB1, BUB3, LRP6, and PTPN12 have been recently proposed to increase CRC risk. We attempted to validate the association between variants in these genes and development of CRC in a systematic review of 11 publications, using sequence data from 863 familial CRC cases and 1604 individuals without CRC (controls). All cases were diagnosed at an age of 55 years or younger and did not carry mutations in an established CRC predisposition gene. We found sufficient evidence for NTHL1 to be considered a CRC predisposition gene--members of 3 unrelated Dutch families were homozygous for inactivating p.Gln90Ter mutations; a Canadian woman with polyposis, CRC, and multiple tumors was reported to be heterozygous for the inactivating NTHL1 p.Gln90Ter/c.709+1G>A mutations; and a man with polyposis was reported to carry p.Gln90Ter/p.Gln287Ter; whereas no inactivating homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were detected in controls. Variants that disrupted RPS20 were detected in a Finnish family with early-onset CRC (p.Val50SerfsTer23), a 39-year old individual with metachronous CRC (p.Leu61GlufsTer11 mutation), and a 41-year-old individual with CRC (missense p.Val54Leu), but not in controls. We therefore found published evidence to support the association between variants in NTHL1 and RPS20 with CRC, but not of other recently reported CRC susceptibility variants. We urge the research community to adopt rigorous statistical and biological approaches coupled with independent replication before making claims of pathogenicity.

ARTICLE
Understanding the genetics of familial CRC is clinically important to discriminate between highand low-risk groups. Mutations in eleven genes are well-established to confer significant increases in CRC risk and testing for these is common in clinical practice. Despite this in many CRC families no genetic diagnosis can be made. While the availability of high-throughput-sequencing has

accelerated searches for new CARCCCgEenPeTsEtDheMreAaNreUcShCalRleInPgTes in assigning pathogenicity to
identified variants.
Here we reviewed the data supporting recent assertions that NTHL1, RPS20, FANCM, FAN1, TP53, BUB1, BUB3, LRP6, and PTPN12 are CRC susceptibility genes using an evidence-based framework (Supplementary-Material)1-7. To search for independent evidence of a role in CRC risk we analyzed sequencing data on 863 familial CRC cases and 1,604 controls8. All cases were diagnosed aged 55 and were mutation-negative for known CRC genes.
Evidence for variation in NTHL1, which like MUTYH performs base-excision-repair (BER), as a cause of recessive-CRC has been provided by three unrelated Dutch families homozygous for the rare inactivating p.Gln90Ter mutation (Supplementary-Material, Supplementary-Table 1)6. The tumor mutation spectrum was enriched for C>T transitions, consistent with defective BER. Subsequently compound heterozygosity for inactivating NTHL1 p.Gln90Ter/c.709+1G>A mutations was identified in a Canadian woman diagnosed with polyposis, CRC and multiple tumors9. Tumors were again enriched for somatic C>T transitions. While we found no p.Gln90Ter homozygotes amongst our WES cases, a 41-year old male case with co-incident polyposis harbored p.Gln90Ter/p.Gln287Ter. No inactivating homozygotes or compound heterozygotes were seen among our 1,604 controls.
Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of a Finnish Amsterdam-positive family demonstrated significant segregation of RPS20 p.Val50SerfsTer23 with early-onset CRC (LOD score=3.0; SupplementaryMaterial, Supplementary-Table 1)3. No disruptive RPS20 variants have been catalogued by the Exome-Aggregation-Consortium (ExAC), which contains WES data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries10 suggesting the gene is intolerant to mutation. Hence, it is notable that in our WES series we identified the disruptive p.Leu61GlufsTer11 mutation in a 39-year old with metachronous CRC. Furthermore we identified the deleterious missense p.Val54Leu in an Amsterdam-positive 41-year old case. No rare missense/disruptive mutations identified in the 1,604 controls.
Smith et al. identified FANCM p.Arg1931Ter in two sporadic CRC cases with cancers showing loss of the wild-type allele (LOH)5. p.Arg1931Ter has been shown to induce exon skipping resulting in

decreased DNA-repair (SupplemeAnCtaCryE-MPTatEeDrialM, SAupNpUleSmCeRntIaPryT-Table 1). In our WES series we
detected p.Arg1931Ter in four cases and one control (P=0.02; Supplementary-Table 3). To seek further evidence for an association between p.Arg1931Ter and CRC, we investigated the frequency of this specific variant in two additional UK series totaling 5,552 cases and 6,792 population controls (published Illumina-Exome-BeadChip data11; Supplementary-Material). Combining these data provided no evidence for an association (Meta-analysis P=0.22; Supplementary Figure 1).
FAN1 mutations have been reported as a cause of CRC in Amsterdam-positive families4, but evidence for segregation was weak (P=0.125) and the evidence for any functional effect of mutation was only shown in non-colonic tissue (Supplementary-Material, Supplementary-Table 1). In our WES series we found no significant increase in the burden of FAN1 mutations in cases (Table 1; Supplementary-Tables 2&3).
Germline mutation of TP53, archetypically associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, has recently been suggested to cause familial CRC at a frequency comparable to APC7. The assertion was, however, based on the flawed assumption that all rare missense changes seen were diseasecausing with no consideration of mutation burden in controls (Supplementary-Material, Supplementary-Table 1). In our data no over-representation of TP53 mutation was seen in cases (Table 1, Supplementary-Tables 2&3).
By WES small numbers of early-onset CRC, BUB1, BUB3, LRP6 and PTPN12 have been proposed as CRC predisposition genes1,2. The published evidence to support assertions is minimal (Supplementary-Material, Supplementary-Table 1) with no evidence of segregation or LOH. Moreover, of the two BUB1 mutation carriers, one also carried a MLH1 mutation which, unlike BUB1, segregated with colorectal tumors. Only for PTPN12 did the authors demonstrate an increase in the burden of mutation in cases versus controls (P=0.039; Supplementary-Material). While we also observed an enrichment of missense PTPN12 mutation in our WES cases (P=0.039; Table 1, Supplementary-Table 3), in light of the number of genes investigated, the evidence for a role in CRC predisposition remains weak.
In conclusion a role for NTHL1 as a bona fide CRC gene is supported by multiple lines of evidence. While compelling, the assertion that mutation of RPS20 causes CRC remains to be established as this observation is based on a single family and the mechanism by which ribosomal proteins might

Broderick et al
predispose to CRC is unclear. InACcoCnEtrPasTt,EDeviMdeAncNeUtoSCsuRpIpPoTrt other genes as risk factors is
currently lacking.
Investigators must remember that private variants are common; of the 7,404,909 variants listed in ExAC, 54% are observed only once10, therefore novel variants should be considered benign until proved otherwise. A studies power to detect a statistically significant association with any rare variant is typically weak, therefore additional evidence must be considered including segregation of the genotype with disease in families, somatic mutation and functional studies with relevance to CRC biology. Critically, where multiple variants are considered within a gene, the burden of variation within controls must also be considered. Since the frequency of variants can be highly population-specific it is essential that controls used for comparison are well matched.
While there is a strong rationale for seeking to identify new CRC genes, well powered studies are required to mitigate against erroneous findings being asserted as causative and subsequently included in databases from which they are seldom deleted. The WES data we have generated represents the largest cohort of CRC exomes sequenced to date. The use of this dataset, which is publically available, to validate observations from small sequencing studies should act to limit the reporting of false positive results. Finally, the evidence framework we have implemented to assess the validity of proposed CRC genes, provides a robust strategy for establishing clinically actionable genes.

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS AND MATERIALS
METHODS INDEPENDENT EVALUATION Whole-exome sequencing data: To search for independent evidence and to contextualize the impact of each purported CRC gene we made use of recently published whole-exome sequencing (WES) data on 1,006 early-onset familial CRC cases and 1,609 healthy controls1. Cases were of European Ancestry recruited to the UK National Study of Colorectal Cancer Genetics (NSCCG)2. All cases were diagnosed with CRC aged 55 and had at least one firstdegree relative diagnosed with CRC. Controls were individuals with no history of malignancy selected from the 1958 Birth Cohort (1958BC), a longitudinal study following the lives of people born in England, Scotland and Wales during the week of 3-9 March 19583. Full details of WES have been published previously. Briefly, paired end fastq files were aligned to build 37 (hg19) of the human reference genome and alignments were processed using the Genome Analysis Tool Kit (GATKv3) pipeline according to best practices4. The Variant Effect Predictor5 was used to provide annotations on the predicted impact of each variant together with functional classifications and assessment of deleteriousness from the CONDEL6 algorithm. Samples (cases and controls) with a variant in an established highpenetrance CRC gene which was predicted to be disruptive (stop-gain, frameshift) or previously catalogued as being pathogenic or likely-pathogenic by InSiGHT (The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours) were removed. Specifically: APC: 19 cases, 1 control; MLH1: 46 cases; MSH2: 46 cases; MSH6: 13 cases, 1 control; MUTYH: 9 cases; PMS2: 6 cases, 2 controls; POLD1: 1 case, 1 control; POLE: 3 cases; BMPR1A, SMAD4, STK11: 0 cases. Thus for the analysis presented in this manuscript we made use of whole-exome sequencing data on 863 cases and 1,604 controls.

Gene Burden Analysis: With currently attainable sample sizes, a studies power to detect a statistically significant association with any rare variant is typically weak. Here we use WES data described above, to look for an enrichment of variation in cases versus controls, for each postulated CRC gene as a whole. As the power of such comparison depends critically on the ability to distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic variation, we defined and compared a number of variant classes: (1) Disruptive mutations (stop-gain, frameshift); (2) Disruptive and predicted damaging mutations (stop-gain, frameshift, missense predicted to be damaging by CONDEL, splice site acceptor/donors); (3) All coding non-synonymous variants. We assessed rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] <1%) and very rare (MAF<0.1%) mutations in each variant class. Comparisons were made using (a) all 863 cases (b) 159 cases with Amsterdam-II positive family histories (Amsterdam-I n=146). Thus in total we performed 12 comparisons for each gene.
Further analysis of the recurrent FANCM p.Arg1931Ter (rs144567652) variant: We studied the association of the recurrent variant FANCM p.Arg1931Ter (rs144567652) with CRC by analyzing published Illumina Infinium Human Exome BeadChip 12v1.0 or 12v1.1 exon array data7. Specifically, we made use of UK case/control data (excluding samples also included in our WES data) comprising: (i) 3,537 English CRC cases and 4,811 control patients; (ii) 2,015 Scottish CRC cases and 1,981 Scottish controls.
EVIDENCE FRAMEWORK
To assess the validity of purported CRC genes, accounting for varying study design, we collated the following evidence where appropriate (Supplementary Table 1):
(1) Where gene/variants were identified through the analysis of multiple members of a single family we evaluated the strength of segregation data ­ co-inheritance of the mutation with affection status (CRC or polyps) in the family. If not formally quantified in the published report we calculated non-parametric linkage (NPL) statistic P-values8 using the family information provided.
(2) Where a specific CRC risk variant was reported: we looked for reported evidence of a statistically significant enrichment in CRC cases versus controls. In conjunction with

our WES data we examined frequency data on the mutation in an ethnically appropriate subset of the Exome-Aggregation-Consortium (ExAC) database9; a catalog of exome sequencing data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries (nonFinnish European (NFE) 33,370 exomes, East Asian (EAS) 4,327 exomes, Finnish (FIN) 3,307 exomes). (3) Where numerous variants are identified in a specific gene: we looked for evidence of gene burden testing in cases versus controls, and if performed, evidence of statistically significant enrichment of mutation in cases. (4) Where recessive inheritance was suspected or indicated: homozygosity or compound-heterozgosity for pathogenic mutations in the proposed CRC gene was assessed in cases and controls. (5) Computational data on the presumptive effect of the variant. (6) Functional data ­ demonstration that mutation has a functional effect and the relevance to CRC biology. (7) Other information ­ evidence of a highly-specific phenotype associated with CRC, evidence of somatic mutation of the wild-type allele in cancers from carriers consistent with tumor suppressor gene function.
REVIEW OF EXISTING LITERATURE FOR EACH GENE ASSESSED
NTHL1
Evidence for variation in NTHL1 as a cause of recessive CRC has been provided by three unrelated Dutch families homozygous for the rare (ExAC NFE MAF=0.0023, homozygosity ~1/75,000) inactivating p.Gln90Ter mutation10. Multiple colorectal adenomas with or without CRC were diagnosed in all seven homozygotes. The tumor mutation spectrum was significantly enriched for C:G>T:A transitions, consistent with the mutation spectra observed in NTHL1 double-knockout mice. Subsequent to this report, compound heterozygosity for inactivating NTHL1 p.Gln90Ter/c.709+1G>A mutations was identified in a 41-year old Canadian woman diagnosed with polyposis, CRC and multiple tumors11. Tumors were again enriched for somatic C:G>T:A transitions.

Evidence Summary: Multiple reports associating homozygosity and compoundheterozygosity with CRC. Evidence of functional effect in CRC.
RPS20
In seven affected members (average age 52, range 24-75) of a four-generation Finnish Amsterdam-positive FCCTX family, Nieminen et al. identified a heterozygous 1-bp duplication, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination (p.Val50SerfsTer23), in RPS2012. The mutation, identified through genetic linkage analysis and WES, showed full cosegregation with microsatellite-stable early-onset CRC thus providing statistically significant evidence (reported LOD score=3.0; calculated NPL=5.35, P=0.0078) for germline mutation in RPS20 as a cause of CRC. The mutation was absent in 292 population controls and is not reported in the ExAC database, which includes 3,307 Finnish individuals. Tumors from mutation carriers did not show loss of the wildtype allele (LOHWT). Lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) from cases carrying p.Val50SerfsTer23 mutation showed a marked increase in 21S pre-rRNAs compared to controls (P-value not calculated), consistent with a late pre-rRNA processing defect and suggestive of RPS20 haploinsufficiency. Germline RPS20 mutations were not found in 25 additional Finnish FCCTX families, 292 population controls or in tumor DNA from 50 primary CRC and 11 CRC cell lines.
Evidence Summary: Statistically significant evidence of segregation, absence of gene mutation in controls. Functional evidence in non-colon tissue. No evidence of somatic mutation or functional effect in CRC.
FANCM
By searching within tumorigenesis genes for rare/novel truncating mutations, which also showed LOHWT within the tumor, Smith et al. identified the FANCM mutation p.Arg1931Ter (rs144567652) in one of 50 sporadic UK CRC cases13. As FANCM is functionally linked to MSH2/MSH6 they sought further evidence for the role of this variant by genotyping an additional case-control series identifying the mutation in 1 of 2,207 CRC cases and 1 of 2,176 controls. The tumor of the additional case again showed LOHWT. Combining discovery and replication samples showed no significant enrichment of the mutation in CRC (cases

2/2,257, controls 1/2,176, P=0.57). Smith et al. presented no segregation or functional data. However, a subsequent report by Peterlongo et al. proposing p.Arg1931Ter as a familial breast cancer risk factor showed that p.Arg1931Ter induces exon skipping resulting in decreased DNA repair activity in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells14. Evidence Summary: Loss of wild-type allele in tumors. Functional evidence in non-colon tissue. No evidence of segregation or functional effect in CRC. No significant enrichment of the mutation in CRC.
FAN1 Through WES of three individuals from a Spanish MMR-proficient, Amsterdam-positive CRC family Sequi et al. identified a novel FAN1 truncating mutation p.Cys47Ter15. Evidence of segregation with CRC was limited (calculated NPL=0.95, P=0.25). Tumors developed by p.Cys47Ter mutation carrier showed no reduction in the expression of wild-type RNA or FAN1 protein. Screening an additional 247 Spanish Amsterdam/Bethesda positive cases for rare (MAF<0.01; dbSNP135) variants identified an additional truncating mutation (p.Arg952Ter) and three missense mutations (p.Asp140Thr and p.Arg591Trp - predicted to be damaging by SIFT and CONDEL algorithms; p.Pro340Ser - predicted to be benign). No FAN1 mutations were identified in 250 population individuals without CRC. Whilst suggestive of an enrichment in cases for the overall burden of variation in FAN1, the size of the control population is insufficient to provide statistically robust support (combined 5/248 cases, 0/250 controls, P=0.061). Using all five families the calculated NPL segregation score was non-significant (NPL=1.05, P= 0.125, Supplementary Table 1). There was no evidence of FAN1 LOH or somatic mutation in tumors from any of the five FAN1 mutation carriers. LCLs derived from p.Cys47Ter and p.Asp140Thr carriers showed greater sensitivity to high doses of mitomycin C (MMC) compared to cells from a wild-type individual (p.Cys47Ter: P=0.01 Wilcoxon rank sum test; p.Asp140Thr: P-value not calculated). Transfection of a FAN1 knockout human embryonic kidney cell line with p.Asp140Thr failed to reverse its MMC sensitivity.

Evidence Summary: Limited evidence of segregation and an increase in mutational burden in cases. Functional evidence for 2/4 mutations in non-colon tissue. No evidence of somatic mutation, LOH or functional effect in CRC.
TP53 Yurgelun et al. examined the frequency of rare germline TP53 missense mutations in 457 patients with early-onset CRC (median age 36, range 15-40) and without a known hereditary cancer syndrome16. In six of the patients (1.3%), they identified missense changes in TP53. No comparison was made to the burden of TP53 mutations in controls. Based on this data they concluded that the frequency of TP53 mutations is comparable with the proportion of inherited CRC thought to be attributable to germline APC mutations. This is a false comparison:
(1) TP53 missense variant are assumed to be deleterious. However, of the six variants they identified only one was predicted to be damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen-2, with three being predicted benign by both algorithms. There was no other evidence that mutations had deleterious functional effect.
(2) The proportion of inherited CRC thought to be attributable to germline APC mutations (1%) is not the same as the frequency of samples with APC missense changes (in our original 1,006 cases, not screened for mutations in known genes, 94 [9.3%] had rare [MAF<1%] missense changes in APC).
Evidence Summary: No comparison was made to mutational burden in controls. No evidence (even in silico) mutations have functional effect. No evidence of segregation or somatic mutation in CRC.

carriers harbored a MLH1 mutation (InSiGHT Class4: likely pathogenic), which unlike the BUB1 variant was also carried by a sibling with polyps. The functional effect of mutations, LOH or somatic mutation within tumors was not assessed. No BUB1 mutations were identified among 184 Netherlands/German cases. Evidence Summary: Absence of identified mutations in controls, but no comparison made to mutational burden in controls. No functional evidence. No evidence of segregation or somatic mutation in CRC.
BUB3: WES identified a novel damaging (as predicted by PolyPhen-2 SIFT, HOPE) missense mutation (p.Phe264Leu) in one of 10 Dutch early-onset (age at diagnosis 45) CRC cases (0/23 Chinese cases)17. Sequencing BUB3 in 174 Netherlands/German CRC cases identified two further missense variants (p.Lys21Asn, p.Arg149Gln) that were predicted (by at least one algorithm) to be damaging, although PolyPhen-2 and SIFT predicted p.Arg149Gln to be benign. All three variants were absent in 1,154 controls but no comparison was made with burden of mutations in controls. No evidence of segregation, LOH or somatic mutation. Lymphocytes and primary skin fibroblasts from p.Phe264Leu and p.Lys21Asn mutation carriers showed significant enrichment of aneuploidy and structural abnormalities versus controls (p.Arg149Gln was not assessed/presented). Evidence Summary: Absence of identified mutations in controls, but no comparison made to mutational burden in controls. Functional evidence in non-colon tissue. No evidence of somatic mutation, LOH or functional effect in CRC.

Analysis of 174 additional Netherlands/German CRC and 2,329 population controls identified no additional damaging missense mutations in cases, with 18 identified in controls including p.Thr867Ala in three controls. By using only the 55 original cases and the 2,329 controls, de Voer et al. reported significant increase in mutation burden in cases versus controls (cases 3/55, controls 18/2,329, P =0.01). However using all cases there was no significant enrichment of LRP6 mutation in cases versus controls (cases 3/229, controls 18/2,329, P=0.43). Evidence Summary: No increase in mutational burden in cases. Functional evidence in noncolon tissue. No evidence of somatic mutation, LOH or functional effect in CRC.
PTPN12: WES identified two damaging missense mutations (p.Arg522Met, p.Ser684Leu) in three of the 55 cases. Analysis of 174 additional Netherlands/German CRC and 2,329 population controls identified a new variant (p.Ala105Val) in one case and 11 variants in controls including previously identified p.Arg522Met in two controls and p.Ser684Leu in three controls. The burden of mutation is cases was significantly enriched versus controls (cases 4/229, controls 11/2329, P=0.039) albeit non-significant after adjustment for multiple testing (three candidate genes, P=0.12). Evidence Summary: Limited evidence of an increase in mutational burden in cases. Variants not absent from controls. No evidence of somatic mutation, LOH or functional effect in CRC.

Supplementary Figure 1: Forest plot of allelic odds ratio associated with FANCM p.Arg1931Ter (rs144567652) genotype and CRC. Studies [SMITH: original publication (2,207 cases, 2,176 controls)13; WES: whole-exome sequencing analyzed in this manuscript (863 cases, 1,604 controls); ENG: English Illumina Exome-BeadChip replication series (3,537 cases, 4,811 controls); SCOT: Scottish Illumina Exome-BeadChip replication series (2,015 cases, 1,981 controls)] were weighted according to the inverse of the variance of the log of the odds ratio (OR) calculated by unconditional logistic regression. Meta-analysis under a fixed-effects model was conducted using standard methods. Cochran's Q statistic to test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic to quantify the proportion of the total variation due to heterogeneity were calculated. Horizontal lines indicate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Boxes indicate OR point estimate; its area is proportional to the weight of the study. Diamond (and broken line) indicates overall summary estimate, with CI given by its width. Unbroken vertical line indicates null value (OR=1.0).

Supplementary Table 2: Gene Burden analysis. Number of WES cases (n=863) and controls (n=1,604) with rare mutations in genes suggested to increase CRC risk. We considered three sets of variants: Class-1, disruptive mutations -stop-gain, frameshift; Class-2, predicted damaging -disruptive plus missense predicted to be damaging by CONDEL and splice site acceptor/donors; Class-3, all coding non-synonymous variants. Tables show -A all cases n=863 and controls -n=1,604 with very rare -MAF<0.1% mutations; -B Amsterdam-II positive cases -n=159 and controls with rare -MAF<1% mutations; -C Amsterdam-II positive cases and controls with very rare -MAF<0.1% mutations. For each gene and variant class, numbers of cases and controls were compared and P-values calculated using Fishers exact test.

Studies [SMITH: original publication (2,207 cases, 2,176 controls)1; WES: whole-exome sequencing analyzed in this manuscript (863 cases, 1,604 controls); ENG: English Illumina Exome-BeadChip replication series (3,537 cases, 4,811 controls); SCOT: Scottish Illumina Exome-BeadChip replication series (2,015 cases, 1,981 controls)] were weighted according to the inverse of the variance of the log of the odds ratio (OR) calculated by unconditional logistic regression. Meta-analysis under a fixed-effects model was conducted using standard methods. Cochran's Q statistic to test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic to quantify the proportion of the total variation due to heterogeneity were calculated. Horizontal lines indicate 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Boxes indicate OR point estimate; its area is proportional to the weight of the study. Diamond (and broken line) indicates overall summary estimate, with CI given by its width. Unbroken vertical line indicates null value (OR=1.0).
