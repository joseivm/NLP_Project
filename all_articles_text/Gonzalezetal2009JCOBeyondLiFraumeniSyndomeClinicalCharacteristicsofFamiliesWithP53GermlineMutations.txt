ABSTRACT
Purpose A clinical testing cohort was used to gain a broader understanding of the spectrum of tumors associated with germline p53 mutations to aid clinicians in identifying high-risk families.
Patients and Methods Full sequencing of the coding exons (2 to 11) and associated splice junctions of the p53 gene was performed on 525 consecutive patients whose blood samples were submitted for diagnostic testing. Clinical features of p53 germline carriers in this cohort were characterized, clinical referral schemes based on reported p53-associated family phenotypes were evaluated, and practical mutation prevalence tables were generated.
Results Mutations were identified in 91 (17%) of 525 patients submitted for testing. All families with a p53 mutation had at least one family member with a sarcoma, breast, brain, or adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). Every individual with a choroid plexus tumor (eight of eight) and 14 of 21 individuals with a childhood ACC had a mutation regardless of family history. Based on reported personal and family history, 95% of patients (71 of 75) with a mutation met either classic Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) or Chompret criteria. A simplified prevalence table provides a concise summary of individual and family characteristics associated with p53 mutations.
Conclusion This is, to our knowledge, the largest single report of diagnostic testing for germline p53 mutations, yielding practical mutation prevalence tables and suggesting clinical utility of classic LFS and Chompret criteria for identifying a subset of cancer-prone families with p53 germline mutations, with important implications for diagnosis and management.

INTRODUCTION
Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS; OMIM #151623) is an autosomal dominant highly penetrant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a variety of early onset tumors. The syndrome, described in 1969 by Li and Fraumeni based on a retrospective analysis of families with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma,1 was characterized by the presence of five cancers: sarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), breast cancer, leukemia, and brain tumors.2,3 LFS is associated with germline mutations in the p53 gene, which codes for a transcription factor implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and genomic stability.4-6 The penetrance of p53-mediated cancer is high and is more pronounced in women than in men (lifetime risk, 93% and 68%, respectively), primarily

due to female breast cancer.7 Females also have an earlier average age of onset (29 years of age in women v 40 years of age in men).8
Several criteria have been developed to identify families at risk for a germline p53 mutation (Table 1). Classic LFS was based on 24 families.2 More inclusive clinical classification schemes were described by Birch9 and Eeles in 1995 to 1996, which characterized Li Fraumeni­like syndrome (LFL) as having "features of the Li Fraumeni syndrome" but that did not "fulfill the strict definition."9,10 The classic LFS, Birch, and Eeles criteria are generally used in clinical practice. More recently, Chompret at al11,12 developed alternative criteria for identifying patients with p53 germline mutations. The Chompret criteria are more restrictive on the cancer types and ages of onset for the proband, but allow for the possibility of a negative family history (Table 1).

Although p53 mutations have been characterized in single institution studies or research cohorts,3,13-18 the performance of the classification criteria or the prevalence of p53 mutations in a clinical testing cohort is unknown. Using family histories and genetic analysis of p53 from the largest cohort evaluated at a single reference laboratory (Clinical Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory [CMDL] at City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA), we present a detailed analysis of the utility of existing clinical classification schemes and provide mutation prevalence tables to aid in the diagnosis of patients with germline p53 mutations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Genotyping p53 DNA from 525 patient samples, sent to the CMDL at City of Hope, was
analyzed for p53 mutations extracted from peripheral blood samples and, in rare cases, from processed DNA. All coding exons (2 to 11) and junctions of the p53 gene were analyzed in both directions by direct DNA sequencing using an automated fluorescent sequencer.
Interpretation of p53 Sequence Changes Truncating mutations were scored as deleterious while missense muta-
tions were scored as deleterious based on previous reports in the International Agency for Research in Cancer germline and somatic databases,19 evolutionary conservation, and available functional data. CMDL uses the epidiomics approach to molecular diagnosis, in that all cases are interpreted in the context of molecular epidemiology and bioinformatics in order to guide the physician in the age of personalized predictive and preventive medicine.
Clinical Data Personal and family cancer histories were collected from test request
forms supplied with the biospecimens. The data collected included tumor type and age of onset for the patients and their family members. Information for affected family members included sex, tumor type, age of onset, number of primary cancers, and relationship to patient tested. Details of germline mutations were provided by the diagnostic laboratory.
Classification of Patients Sent for p53 Testing In total, 341 of 525 patient samples (75 p53 positive and 266 p53 negative)
were accompanied by sufficient family history (at least a three generation pedigree including types of cancer and ages of onset) to be classified according

to the following classification schema: classic LFS, Birch, Eeles, and/or Chompret (Table 1). Standard classification criteria were used (International Agency for Research in Cancer; www-p53.iarc.fr), as in previous studies.4,9,14,15,19,20 As necessary to conform to the various schema, proband was designated as either the patient tested or a first- or second-degree relative (based on the type and age of the cancer).
Data Analysis Sensitivity and specificity were estimated as the respective fractions of all
classified p53-positive or p53-negative patients for each of the four classification schema: classic LFS, Chompret, Birch, and Eeles. An analysis of the cumulative yield of these schema was also derived in the same order without overlap. Because the data are consecutive referrals to a clinical laboratory, the empirical estimates of the prevalence of p53 mutations in clinical samples were regarded as estimates of the predictive value of the classification schema. The clinical prevalence of p53 mutations was also determined based on types of cancer and ages of onset in the patient and their family members. Fisher's exact tests and rank-sum tests were computed using StatXact (CYTEL Software Corp, Cambridge, MA).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics Characteristics of patients tested are described in Table 2. Muta-
tions were identified in 91 (17%) of 525 patients tested. The number of patients meeting a given classification scheme is indicated. Many patients met more than one classification scheme. The majority met Chompret and/or Eeles classification (57% and 60%, respectively); 13% of patients did not meet the criteria for any classification scheme. Breast cancer was the most common cancer among patients tested, accounting for 35% of all primary tumors while multiple primary cancers were also found in 35% of patients.
Performance of Current Classification Schema Among the 341 classified patients, the p53 mutation detection
rate for patients meeting classic LFS was 56%, with a sensitivity of 40% and a specificity of 91% (Table 3). The Chompret classification detection rate was 36%. The LFL classification (Birch and Eeles), which by definition excludes patients meeting classic LFS, showed detection

Age of onset was provided for a total of 379 patients. Cancer type was known for a total of 380 patients; there was a total of 596 tumors in these 380 patients. Ten patients sent for testing had no primary cancers. §Total of 390 patients (380 with cancer and 10 without cancer).

rates of 16% and 14%, respectively. Classic LFS and Chompret criteria together conferred a testing sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 52%. When examining clinical classification based on a hierarchy, only one additional case was identified by each of the LFL criteria (Birch and Eeles).
p53 Is Associated With a Wide Spectrum of Cancers Some cancer types not typically associated with LFS (eg, cancers
of the ovary, pancreas, and prostate) were observed in patients with germline p53 mutations (Table 4). This wide spectrum of cancers was also observed among pediatric cancers (Appendix Table A1, online

only). Of the four reported ovarian cancers, one was a germ cell cancer, one a teratoma, while the other two did not specify pathologic subtype. The four core cancers (breast cancer, sarcoma, brain cancer, ACC) accounted for 77% of all associated cancers. The median and average ages of onset of cancer varied with cancer type: ACC and choroid plexus carcinoma were among the earliest while melanoma and prostate cancer were among the latest ages of onset (data not shown).
Four Core Cancers Help Define "p53-opathy" All p53-positive patients had at least one member of the family
with sarcoma, brain tumor, breast cancer, or ACC. No p53 mutations (zero of 21) were detected in families where no members have a core cancer under the age of 50 (Table 5). Sarcoma, brain tumor, breast cancer, and ACC were therefore referred to as germline p53 core cancers.
Choroid Plexus Tumor Is Strongly Associated With Germline p53 Mutations
Eight patients with choroid plexus tumor (CPC) were referred for sequencing of the p53 gene. These patients all had a negative family history among ancestors and very young ages of onset. An additional individual with four primary cancers who had a grandson with CPC was sent for testing. Among these nine patients, clinical classification was determined only for seven as insufficient family history information was provided for two patients. Three of seven classified patients met the Chompret classification alone, two met both Chompret and Eeles classifications, one met Chompret and classic LFS, and one patient did not meet any classification. All nine patients (100%) had identifiable mutations. Two patients, both meeting only the Chompret classification, had de novo mutations as determined by of absence of the p53 mutation in both biologic parents (data not shown).
ACC Is a Strong Indicator of a p53 Germline Mutation Of the 21 patients with ACC that were sent for p53 testing, 14 had
a p53 mutation (67%). All patients with ACC at any age of onset, regardless of family history, meet the Chompret criteria (Table 1). Among the 14 positive patients, seven met Chompret alone; two also met classic LFS, and four also met Eeles. One patient could not be classified due to insufficient family history. None of the patients with ACC met Birch. Three of seven patients, diagnosed with ACC at ages

core cancers had a 0% (zero of 15) chance of having a p53 mutation (Appendix Table A2, online only). In contrast, a patient with breast cancer under age 30 and family history of one or more core cancers in a first- or second-degree relative (one of the core cancers being something other than breast) had a 100% chance (five of five) of having a p53 mutation. Testing of the p53 gene was negative in two patients with bilateral breast cancer and no cancer in first- or second-degree relatives. However, patients with unilateral breast cancer younger than age 30 and no cancer in first- or second-degree relatives had a 7% chance (one of 14) of having a p53 mutation.
p53 Mutations in Patients With Leukemia Among the 341 classified patients, 18 patients had leukemia.
Only two of these 18 patients (11%) had a p53 mutation. However, these two patients also had other typical LFS cancers. One patient had breast cancer at age 25 and leukemia at age 27, while the second patient had sarcoma at ages 9 months and 15 years and leukemia at age 17.
Mutation Prevalence Tables for p53 Mutation prevalence Tables were compiled based on the exten-
sive clinical data obtained from patient family histories (Tables 5 and A2). The highest mutation frequency (100%) was among patients with childhood cancers with only one family member with at least one core cancer as well as one or more family member with a non-core cancer. Another high mutation prevalence (88%) was among patients with two or more core cancers, at least one at or under the age of 40 and two or more family members with core cancers.
Germline p53 Mutations Cause Multiple Primary Cancers and Early Onset of Cancer
Patients submitted for testing who did not have mutations generally had a less dramatic family phenotype. Fifty percent of p53positive patients had more than one primary cancer compared to 32% of p53-negative patients. Patients with two or more primary cancers were significantly more likely to have a mutation (P  .005). The average age of onset of the first cancer among patients with a p53 mutation was 21.9 years of age, versus an average of 31.6 years in patients without a p53 mutation. Among the 75 classified p53-positve patients, the median age of onset of the first cancer was 25 years, significantly younger (35 years, P  .005) than the 266 classified p53-negative patients. The range of onset in the p53-positive patients was 4 months to 49 years.
Distribution of First Cancer Type and Age of Onset by Sex
Excluding sex-specific cancers, there was no significant difference in the average age of onset of the first cancer in males versus females in patients with p53 mutations (Table 4). Likewise, excluding sex-specific cancers, the sex ratio of tumors overall was not significantly different. The data suggest that the excess of tumors in females derives overwhelmingly from their predisposition to breast cancer (online-only Appendix, Supplementary Results). Among specific tumor types, ACC was seen more commonly in females (3.7:1, females: males, respectively), a ratio that was significantly different from that found in the general population (approximately 1.4:1, females: males, P  .0375).21

DISCUSSION
Identifying families with p53 mutations is a daunting task given the wide variety of cancer types associated with LFS. This study is, to our knowledge, the largest reported cohort (525 families) analyzed to date and includes comprehensive personal and family history data on 75 of 91 p53-positive and 266 of 434 p53-negative families. Our data suggests that although classic LFS remains the indicator with the highest predictive value for mutation status, Chompret's classification dramatically improved sensitivity. This report provides mutation prevalence Tables as clinical tools to facilitate the identification of families with p53 germline mutations.
Because all p53-positive families had at least one member of the family with sarcoma, brain tumor, breast cancer, or ACC younger than the age of 50, these four cancers were confirmed as core cancers. While previous studies indicated that these four cancers were strongly associated with LFS and p53 mutations,3 this study is the first to suggest that families without at least one member with a core cancer are highly unlikely to have a p53 mutation. One important caveat is the ascertainment bias inherent in the analysis of patients referred for genetic testing. Given the published classification schema, most patients sent for testing had a core cancer or at least one family member with a core cancer.
Previous studies and reviews have reported that approximately 70% to 80% of families meeting classic LFS have p53 mutations.7,22-25 Herein, the detection rate for families meeting classic LFS was somewhat lower (56%). However, we found a higher than anticipated detection rate for the Chompret classification (35% v approximately 20% reported in Chompret et al11). Varley et al22 found that 40% (12 of 30) of patients meeting LFL classification had an identifiable p53 germline mutation. A review on p53 showed about an 8% mutation frequency for Eeles classification and 22% to 40% for Birch.7 In the initial description of the Birch classification, a p53 mutation was detected in 11% of patients.9 The same group indicated in a subsequent analysis that less than 25% of patients meeting the Birch classification had a p53 mutation.26 In the description of patients meeting Eeles classification, approximately 7% of patients had a mutation, based on analysis of 61 patients.10 Evans et al,27 citing their cumulative survey of LFL families to date, have suggested that the LFL classification has a much higher positive predictive value (up to 40% to 50%) than the Chompret criteria. In this study of a series of patients sent for p53 germline testing in a clinical diagnostic laboratory, the positive predictive value of the Chompret criteria (35%) was slightly higher than the combined positive predictive values of the Birch (16%) and Eeles (14%) classifications for LFL. In addition, the cumulative sensitivity of the Chompret plus classic LFS identified 95% of the p53-positive patients, missing only four additional p53-positive patients (one each meeting Birch and Eeles and two meeting no criteria). While the LFL classification, Birch, and Eeles, showed detection rates of 16% and 14%, when examining clinical classification based on a hierarchy, the utility of these classifications diminish as the detection rates drop to 3% and 2%, respectively. Generally, the Chompret classification performs better because it identifies probands with ACC or multiple primary tumors but no family history, which would have been excluded by the other classification schema.

Clinical Features and Germline p53 Mutation Prevalence

Among the 75 individuals with p53 mutations, only two had leukemia (2.7%) and both had multiple primary cancers (one patient was first diagnosed with breast cancer; the other was first diagnosed with two primary sarcomas at 9 months and 15 years). Therefore, the leukemia diagnosis was not necessary to prompt p53 testing for these two patients. Leukemia was initially considered one of the main components of LFS based on an analysis of the first 24 kindreds identified with LFS. These included 52 primary cancers, four of which were leukemia (7.7%).3 The second primary cancer was not considered in the analysis which may introduce a bias given that, as the results herein show, approximately 50% of patients with p53 germline mutations have more than one primary cancer. The contribution of leukemia to LFS was questioned by Birch18 who noted the disease in just seven of 28 families in their cohort. It is unclear from the analysis whether these seven individuals had other primary cancers. Our data show that just 14 leukemias (8.4%) among 167 cancers are in family members of patients with p53 mutations. These data are consistent with the notion of a weak association, although different sampling designs would be necessary to estimate the risk of leukemia associated with p53 mutations.
There is a strong link between individuals with CPC or ACC, especially those occurring in childhood, and germline p53 mutations. We recommend genetic testing of p53 if an individual meets one of the following criteria: a patient with a CPC or an ACC, or a family meeting classic LFS or Chompret criteria. If the Chompret criteria are modified to include any patient with CPC, regardless of family history, all but one of the positive patients in our series meet classic LFS or Chompret criteria (99%). Given the relatively high detection rate of p53 mutations in this study, p53 germline mutations may be more common than previously appreciated. We estimate that the frequency of p53 germline mutations may be as high as 1 in 20,000 (Appendix Table A3, online only).
In summary, this study is the first large series of p53 testing for LFS reflective of clinical practice and not biased by specific selec-

tion criteria. We did not select patients on the basis of family history or particular types of tumors. The range of patients submitted for testing varied widely. One limitation of this study is that the data for pathology of the patient's tumor and the family history data were provided by the clinician ordering the genetic testing and, therefore, were not confirmed by the study investigators. This study highlights the potential benefits of critical analysis of diagnostic laboratory testing outcomes, and the importance of adequate clinical information supplied by the healthcare provider. The p53 mutation prevalence tables should prove to be useful tools for clinicians considering the diagnosis of LFS.

Glossary Terms

Transcription factor: A DNA-binding protein that func-
tions to initiate, enhance, inhibit, or reduce the transcription of a gene. They act by promoting the formation of the pre-initiation complex (PIC), which recruits and activates RNA polymerase.
Penetrance: The likelihood that a given gene mutation will
produce disease. This likelihood is calculated by examining the proportion of people with the particular genetic mutation that show symptoms of disease.
Missense mutation: A change (mutation) in one nucleotide
that results in the coding of a different amino acid.
Germline mutation: An inherited variation in the lineage of
germ cells. Germline mutations can be passed on to offspring.

Truncating mutation: Any mutation which causes premature
truncation of the normal protein product. Examples of mutations that can cause truncation are nonsense mutations and out-of-frame deletions, insertions, or indels.
Apoptosis: Also called programmed cell death, it is a signaling
pathway that leads to cellular suicide in an organized manner. Several factors and receptors are specific to the apoptotic pathway. The net result is that cells shrink, develop blebs on their surface, and their DNA undergoes fragmentation.
Autosomal: Any chromosome not related to the sex chromo-
somes (X or Y). The autosomes are chromosomes 1-22.
Dominant: A dominant gene refers to the allele that causes a phe-
notype that is seen in a heterozygous genotype.
