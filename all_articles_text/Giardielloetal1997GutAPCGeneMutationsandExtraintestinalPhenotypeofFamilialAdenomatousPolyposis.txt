accounting for person years of exposure, only the rate of cutaneous cysts distinguished patients with APC gene mutations when confidence limits between the two groups were considered. Adjustment for relative's distance from the proband in multiple logistic regression models found no evidence of significant confounding.
Among the 475 patients studied, the presence of an extraintestinal manifestation
increased the likelihood that the person would have an identified APC gene mutation. If an FAP patient was affected by extraintestinal cancer or cutaneous cysts, the conditional probability of detection of an APC gene mutation in the family was 94% and 92%, respectively, compared with 82% of all families in the study (p<005). The presence of
osteomas (9 1%), POFLs (9 1O%), and desmoids (89%) also indicated a trend towards increased likelihood, but occult radio-opaque jaw lesions (8 1%) and odontomas (79%) did not.
Linkage analysis was peformed on one large, informative family in which no germline APC gene mutation was identified. Two point lod scores for markers on chromosome 5q21 flanking the APC gene are shown in Table II. Close linkage to this region was detected by the high lod score (51) for D5S346 for recombination fraction values (theta) less than 5%.
Replication errors characteristic of tumours with mutations in mismatch repair genes were absent in the DNA from neoplasms of all 16 patients representing the five pedigrees in which no germline mutation of the APC gene

mutation could be identified, including the family evaluated by linkage analysis.
An association between site of APC gene mutation and extraintestinal manifestation (evaluated by both frequency of positivity and person year analysis) was found only for POFLs (Fig 1). Eye lesions were noted with low frequency of positivity for patients with mutations that occurred 5' to codon 541. All patients with mutations in codons 542-1309 were positive for POFLs and then the frequency of eye lesions decreased 3' to codon 1309. Variance of extraintestinal manifestations within pedigrees did not correlate with the relation to the proband.
The influence of site of APC gene mutation on multiplicity of extraintestinal manifestations is shown in Figure 2. The rate of events/person year (lambda) appeared relatively consistent throughout the gene except for a high rate in patients with mutations in codons 1465, 1546, and 2621 and a dearth of multiplicity of manifestations with mutation in codon 436. Multiple regression analysis of these relations did not reveal significant associations between mutation site and particular combinations of extraintestinal manifestations.
Discussion This study identified a low frequency of extraintestinal manifestations in patients from FAP families not found to have APC gene mutation. A potential reason for this phenomenon is that some of these individuals have APC mutations which are not detected by current methods and which, at the same time, do not predispose to extraintestinal manifestations. This includes APC mutations in splice sites or intronic regions, mutations that affect the protein product qualitatively and not quantitatively, and mutations that produce subtle modifications in the protein. Alternatively, mutation of another gene could be the

occurs through environmental influences and modifying gene(s), as suggested by the MIN mouse model of FAP which has germline mutation in the mouse homologue ofAPC.3740 Understanding the function of the APC gene in various tissues may eventually explain the
clinical observations.

genotype-phenotype associations with extraintestinal manifestations27-30 while others have not.'5 16 33 34 Olschwang et al reported that POFLs in FAP patients did not occur with
mutations in codons 136-302 but did occur with mutations in codons 463-1387.27 Caspari et al and Davies et al extended these observations by noting an absence of POFLs in patients with mutations in codons 1445-1578.2829 Our evaluation, both by frequency and person year analysis, supports the findings that mutations in the 5' and 3' ends of the APC gene do not predispose to POFLs. However, this association was not absolute, since we did find patients with POFLs who had mutations at codons 215 and 1546.
Caspari et al28 also described a high frequency of desmoid tumours (33/36; 92%) in individuals with mutations of codons 1445-1578. Davies et al made a similar observation.29 Our study identified 12 patients with mutations in this region and five (42%) did have desmoids. In addition, desmoids/

individuals who have inherited a mutated APC
gene and will develop FAP.4 The available
method detects APC gene mutation in ap-
proximately 80% of FAP pedigrees7 (82% in this study). Our findings show that the
presence of extraintestinal cancer or cutaneous
cysts in an FAP pedigree significantly increases the pretest probability that an APC gene
mutation will be identified in affected
members. Moreover, the presence of POFLs can guide genetic analysis to reduce costs. The expense of APC gene testing, primarily because of the cost of laboratory reagents, can be a barrier to use by patient and physician. In this regard, finding POFLs in the pedigree allows direction of initial molecular analysis to specific segments of the APC gene (codons 463-1387), thereby reducing initial cost which
would result if the entire gene was evaluated.

Extraintestinal phenotype ofAPC gene mutation

The results of genetic tests can help guide
surveillance. For example, families with mutations in codons 1465-1546 deserve clinical
attention directed at their proclivity for
multiple extraintestinal manifestations. It is clear, however, that extraintestinal lesions can occur with a wide spectrum of APC gene mutations. Lastly, because nearly one fifth of FAP families have no mutation identified with current methods, studies directed at finding mechanisms of germline APC inactivation and
at other potential genes remain important.
