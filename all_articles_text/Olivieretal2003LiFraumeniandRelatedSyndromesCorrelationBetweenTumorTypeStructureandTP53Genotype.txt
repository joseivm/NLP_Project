ABSTRACT

stress; reviewed in Ref. 10). Loss of p53 function is thought to

A database has been created to collect information on families carrying a germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene and on families affected with Li-Fraumeni syndromes [Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and Li-Fraumenilike syndrome (LFL)]. Data from the published literature have been included. The database is available online at http://www.iarc.fr/p53, as part of the IARC TP53 Database. The analysis of the 265 families/ individuals that have been included thus far has revealed several new findings. In classical LFS families with a germ-line TP53 mutation (83 families), the mean age of onset of breast cancer was significantly lower than in LFS families (16 families) without a TP53 mutation (34.6 versus 42.5 years; P  0.0035). In individuals with a TP53 mutation, a correlation between the genotype and phenotype was found. Brain tumors were associated with missense TP53 mutations located in the DNA-binding loop that contact the minor groove of DNA (P  0.01), whereas adrenal gland carcinomas were associated with missense mutations located in the loops opposing the protein-DNA contact surface (P  0.003). Finally, mutations likely to result in a null phenotype (absence of the protein or loss of function) were associated with earlier onset brain tumors (P  0.004). These observations have clinical implications for genetic testing and tumor surveillance in LFS/LFL families.

suppress a mechanism of protection against accumulation of genetic alterations. Somatic TP53 genetic alterations are frequent in a variety of human sporadic cancers, with frequencies varying from 10 to 60%, depending on the tumor type or population group (11). These alterations are compiled in the IARC TP53 Database and can be searched online (12).4 Mutations observed in the germ line and in sporadic cases are very similar (13), with a majority of missense mutations (75%) usually resulting in a defective transcriptional activity. Mutations are scattered throughout the coding sequence of the gene, all codons in the DNA binding domain being mutated at least once (11). However, 30% of mutations cluster at 8 "hotspot" codons (codons 175, 176, 220, 245, 248, 249, 273, and 282). Thus, TP53 differs from other tumor suppressors such as RB1, APC, or BRCA1/2, which are inactivated frequently by deletions or nonsense mutations.
Despite a wide research interest in TP53 and LFSs, not all of the underlying genetic defects responsible for LFS have been found. In several families fulfilling the definition of classical LFS, no defect in TP53 has been found. On the other hand, some families having a germ-line mutation in TP53 display some, but not all features of LFS.

These families are referred to as LFL (7, 9, 14). To aid the study of

LFS3 is a rare autosomal disorder characterized by a familial clustering of tumors, with a predominance of sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, and adrenocortical carcinomas, diagnosed before the age of 45 years (1). Other cancers, such as leukemia, lung cancer, skin melanoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer are also present in excess in some families and, in some cases, germ cell tumors, choroid plexus papilloma, and Wilms' tumor have been reported as part of the spectrum (2­5). In 1990, Malkin et al. (6) found that a few LFS families had a germ-line mutation in the tumor

This database is a redesigned and extended version of the IARC database of germ-line mutations described in Kleihues et al. (13).

Database Design. A relational database was created to enter information on families with LFS/LFL syndromes and those with a germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene. The database was designed using Microsoft Access software. Data on members with cancer and obligate TP53 mutation carriers in each family were entered, as well as family structure, tumor samples, details of the germ-line mutation, mutation detection method, and the publication in which the family is described. The central element of the database is the family information unit to which are connected the individual information unit, the germ-line mutation information units (TP53 and CHEK2, with mutation detection methods), and the reference information unit. The tumor information unit is connected to the individual information unit (see Fig. 1). Indexes were used to annotate data in a standardized way. The current structure of the database allows the addition of new table(s) to enter any novel germ-line mutation data if required. Indeed, an alternative susceptibility gene may be involved in some of the LFS and LFL families for which no germ-line mutation has been found. Details of annotations can be found on the internet.4
Family Classification. Family history was defined as follows. LFS (classical LFS) refers to proband with sarcoma at 45 years, and a first-degree relative with tumor at 45 and another close relative with tumor at 45 or
4 Internet address: http://www.iarc.fr/p53.

sarcoma at any age (1). LFL refers to LFL in which we grouped Birch definition (LFL-B; Ref. 7), and Eeles (two definitions; LFL-E1 and LFL-E2). LFL-E1 (first definition of LFL by Eeles; Ref. 14) refers to two different tumors that are part of extended LFS in first- or second-degree relatives at any age (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, adrenocortical tumor, melanoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer). LFL-E2 refers to sarcoma at any age in the proband with two of the following (two of the tumors may be in the same individual): breast cancer at 50 years and/or brain tumor, leukemia, adrenocortical tumor, melanoma, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer at 60 years, or sarcoma at any age (15). LFL-B refers to proband with any childhood cancer or sarcoma, brain tumor or adrenocortical carcinoma at 45 years, with one first- or second-degree relative with typical LFS cancer (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, or adrenocortical carcinoma) at any age, plus one first- or second-degree relative in the same lineage with any cancer diagnosed under age 60. FH refers to family history of cancer that does not fulfill LFS or any of the LFL definitions (Birch, Eeles E1, or E2,) and No FH refers to no family history of cancer.
Tumor Classification. In the database, tumors are identified by their site (topography) and their histology (morphology) according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology classification (16). Because precise information on tumor histology is rarely given in the original publication, the majority of the tumors are classified as "tumor" or "cancer" in the database. For data analyses, tumors were recoded according to their topography/histology: tumors with the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology codes C18 to C20 were grouped as colorectal cancer, leukemia and lymphoma were grouped together, and sarcomas were divided into soft tissue sarcomas and bone sarcomas. Benign lesions and tumors of unknown origin were excluded. Multiple primary tumors in patients were counted individually.
Dataset Description and Statistical Analysis. For the comparison of tumor spectra in LFS families with and without a mutation, the strict clinical definition of LFS was used. All of the tumors described in those families have been included, whether or not the individuals have been tested for the presence of a TP53 mutation. Tumors in proband/index cases were included (35% were in probands for LFS-wt and 25% for LFS-mut). Analyses have been repeated excluding tumors in proband cases, and the results are qualitatively unchanged.
For the analysis of genotype/phenotype association, tumors in individuals proven to carry a TP53 mutation and from families with a history of cancer (LFS, LFL, and FH) have been selected, including proband/index cases (55% of the tumors were in probands). To correct for nonindependence of tumors from members of the same family, robust variance estimators were used. TP53 mutations were classified into type groups and structural groups as shown in

Table 1. Analysis of the incidence of tumor types by mutation groups was done using multinomial logistic regression with adjustment of the variance for family membership. Analysis of the number/proportion of each tumor type in each family by mutation type and structure was done using Poisson regression. Age at diagnosis for each tumor was compared through the use of generalized linear models, adjusted for family. Before analysis, age at diagnosis was log-transformed to reduce skewness and heteroscedasticity. ANOVA was used to test for effects of mutation structure type (and their interaction) on mean and total severity score. When a significant overall effect of mutation structure or type was found the following three independent comparisons were made: (a) mutations in DNA binding domain: L2/L3 versus L1 loops (group 1 versus group 2); (b) missense mutations: DNA-binding versus non-DNA-binding (groups 1  2 versus 3); and (c) all mutations: missense versus truncating (groups 1  2  3 versus 4). All of the statistical analyses were done using STATA v7.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas).

RESULTS

Database Scope and Availability. A new relational database has

been created to compile published information on families fulfilling

the definition of Li-Fraumeni and related syndromes, and on individ-

uals carrying a germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene. Data were

extracted from peer-reviewed articles published between 1990 and June 2002. Unpublished data on 9 families were also included.5

Criteria for inclusion were the following: (a) individuals carrying a

sequenced TP53 germ-line mutation, affected or not by a cancer; and

(b) individuals affected by a cancer and belonging to a family defined

as LFS or LFL (using LFL-E1, -E2, and -B as defined in "Materials

and Methods"), with or without a TP53 germ-line mutation. Because

we mainly concentrated on individuals carrying a TP53 germ-line

mutation, the database did not include LFS or LFL families described

in the literature for which TP53 mutational status has not been

TP53 Status and Tumor Spectrum in LFS Individuals. The

dataset included in the database comprises 265 families (Table 2).

Two hundred and twenty-six germ-line TP53 mutations were present

in 223 families (1 family had 2 TP53 germ-line mutations and 1 had

3 TP53 mutations). Five families had a CHEK2 (OMIM #604373)

mutation, and 1 family had a CDKN2A (OMIM #600160) mutation.

Thirty-six families did not have any identified mutation. There are a

total of 1262 tumors recorded in the database, of which 564 are in

individuals with confirmed TP53 germ-line mutations or obligate

carriers of such mutations. Sixty-seven unaffected individuals who

were confirmed or obligate TP53 carriers were recorded.

Among the 99 families fulfilling the classical definition of LFS (see

"Materials and Methods") and screened for TP53 mutation, 83 have a

TP53 mutation (LFS-mut), and 16 have no mutation in TP53 (LFS-

wt). The absence of TP53 mutation in those families has been confirmed by screening the entire coding region of TP53 as well as flanking regions, and by using different techniques in 15 of the families. One family has been screened from exon 5 to 9. Thus, it is possible to compare with good confidence the tumor spectrum in LFS

In the absence of an identified TP53 mutation, it is not possible to precisely delineate the limits of the pedigree, and we have included all of the tumors reported in the family tree. Therefore, it is likely that some of these tumors are phenocopies. Nonetheless, the difference observed for brain tumors is still valid if we restrict the analysis to the five main LFS tumor types (breast, brain, bone, soft tissue, and

gender distribution is similar to the one of sporadic cancers observed

in the general population with the exception of adrenocortical carcinoma, which occur significantly (P  0.001) more frequently in

females than in males in TP53 mutation carriers compared with

sporadic cases in the general population (Table 3). However, most

adrenocortical carcinoma cases are from United Kingdom (17 of 32

cases with 2 of 17 in females), where an excess of females has been

reported in childhood adrenocortical carcinoma. Thus, it is not clear

whether the observed excess of females is related to the presence of a

TP53 mutation or to other genetic or environmental factors (17).

The age at onset of tumors in TP53 mutation carriers varies with

tumor site; however, all of the inherited tumors show an earlier age at

onset compared with their sporadic cancer counterparts (Table 3).

When looking at the age distribution of the major cancer sites, brain

tumor and soft tissue sarcoma show nonsymetric distributions, with a

high prevalence of cases before the age of 10 (Fig. 3). The prevalence

decreases in the 10 ­20 years range and increases again after 20 years

for brain tumors, whereas soft tissue sarcomas show a constant prev-

alence after 10 years. Thus, despite similar median age at diagnosis

for soft tissue sarcoma and bone sarcoma (Table 3), soft tissue

sarcomas occur more frequently in childhood (0 ­10 years), whereas

bone sarcomas are more prevalent in teenagers (11­20 years; Fig. 3).

The age distribution for breast cancer and adrenocortical carcinoma

reflects the median age at onset for these tumors (34 and 3 years,

respectively). There was a trend for later onset brain tumors and soft

tissue sarcomas in females compared with males (median age: 28

versus 11 years for brain tumors and 19 versus 11 years soft tissue

sarcomas), although neither was statistically significant.

Genotype/Phenotype Correlations in TP53 Mutation Carriers.

Many in vitro experiments have shown that not all of the TP53

mutations are functionally equivalent, some exhibiting gain of func-

tion and/or dominant-negative properties (reviewed in Ref. 18). Thus,

it is expected that TP53 germ-line mutants may have distinct biolog-

ical properties that could promote tumorigenesis in distinct organ

sites. To investigate this possibility, we searched for associations

between tumor type and mutation type on the dataset of individuals

who were confirmed or obligate TP53 mutation carriers and who had

a family history of cancer (LFS, LFL, or FH).

The type and location of TP53 germ-line mutations observed in

those individuals is shown in Table 4 (only one mutation by family is

included). The majority of these mutations are missense mutations

(72%) and deletions (10%). Most of the deletions are small (1­ 4 bp)

and induce a frameshift (data not shown). Overall, 46% of the mis-

sense mutations were located at codons 175, 213, 245, 248, 273, and

282. These codons are classic mutation hotspots in most forms of

sporadic cancers and correspond mostly to transition mutations at

cytosines within pyrimidine repeats (CpG sites; Ref. 11). Codons 133,

152, and 337 were the next more frequently mutated codons. Muta-

tions at codons 152 and 337 are transitions at CpG sites, whereas mutations at codon 133 were ATCG and ATGC. These codons are rarely mutated in sporadic tumors (0.8% of all somatic mutations;

IARC TP53 Database; R7). Transitions at CpG sites and small deletions are thought to result from endogenous mutagenic processes, i.e. spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine for transitions at CpG and polymerase slippage during replication for small deletions (19, 20). Thus, 60% of the germ-line mutations described for these

p53 contains two distinct parts. Group 3 includes all of the missense mutations outside groups 1 and 2 (located in the non-DNA-binding loops, in the -sheet scaffold of the p53 protein, or in the oligomerization domain). Group 4 includes mutations expected to confer a "p53-null" phenotype (insertions or deletions with frameshift and nonsense mutations). The prevalence of the most frequent cancers (breast cancer, brain tumor, adrenocortical carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and bone sarcoma) was calculated for each group of mutation as shown in Table 5. There was a statistically significant association between tumor type and mutation group, attributable mainly to brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas. Brain tumors were more likely to be associated with group 1 mutations compared with all of the other groups (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2­3.7; P  0.01) and adrenal tumors with group 3 mutations compared with all of the other groups (odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3­ 6.4; P  0.008). For brain tumors, most of the effect was in differences between L2/L3 loops versus L1 loop (P  0.03). For adrenal cancers, the difference was confined to missense mutations in the non-DNA-binding domain versus missense mutations in the DNAbinding domain (P  0.003). No other tumor type exhibited significant variation across structural group, and there was no association between family classification (LFS versus LFL versus FH) and structural group of mutation. No correlation was found between mutation type (defined by the nature of the base change) and tumor type.
Breast and brain tumors showed significant differences in age at diagnosis. The major difference for breast cancer was between missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain versus missense mutations not in the DNA-binding domain (32 years for groups 1  2 versus 42 for group 3; P  0.006). For brain tumor, the major effect

could be seen in the comparison between null and non-null mutations (9 years for group 4 versus 25.5 years for groups 1  23; P  0.004). No association was found between age at onset and mutation type when defined by the nature of the base change.
For brain tumors, 80% of group 1 mutations were at codons 248, 245, and 175. Codon 248 contacts directly with DNA in the minor groove, whereas codons 245 and 175 support and stabilize the L3 loop (Fig. 4). These codons are classical hotspot mutations and correspond to mutant proteins exhibiting loss of transactivation function and dominant-negative effects (on the wt p53 protein) in some cell-types (21). In individuals with adrenocortical carcinomas, 60% of group 3 mutations were at codons 151, 152, 219, and 220 that form a cluster of residues, which oppose with the DNA-binding surface of the protein (Fig. 4). These residues are not classical hotspots in sporadic cancers, but they are conserved among vertebrate, and in vitro functional assays have shown that they have impaired transcriptional activities (22, 23).
DISCUSSION
Since the discovery of the involvement of TP53 in LFS, the classical clinical definition of LFS has been revisited by several groups, because certain families carrying a TP53 mutation do not fulfill this definition (7, 15, 24). In LFS families without a TP53 mutation, several candidate genes have been screened. Of these, only the CHEK2 gene was found to be mutant in a limited number of families (25­28). However, from subsequent studies, it has become clear that the presence of a CHEK2 mutation probably does not predispose to LFS per se, but only to the breast cancers that have occurred within the context of families that match the LFS/LFL phenotype (29). Thus, TP53 mutation remains the only molecular explanation for this syndrome, and a better knowledge of the tumor spectrum associated with TP53 mutation would help clinicians to identify individuals who should be tested for germ-line TP53 mutation. Because LFS is a rare syndrome, this question would be more efficiently addressed in collaborative studies. In an attempt to set the ground for such a collaborative effort, we have created an international database based on the published literature of LFS/LFL families and of individuals with TP53 germ-line mutations. This database has been designed to enter detailed information on family structure, individual characteristics, tumor pathology, mutation description, and detection method. It is available on-line4 at the site that also provides access to the IARC TP53 database of somatic mutations.
To investigate how TP53 mutation influences the tumor spectrum observed in LFS/LFL individuals, we have performed an analysis of the dataset assembled in the 2002 update of the database. The comparison of tumor spectra in LFS families (including only those fulfilling the classical definition) with or without a TP53 mutation showed that LFS-mut individuals have more brain tumors, have exclusively adrenocortical carcinoma, and have earlier onset breast cancer. No difference was observed for sarcomas between the two

ciated with earlier onset tumors, in particular for brain tumors. This

suggests that these null mutations have a particularly severe effect or, alternatively, they could predispose to tumors of different histological types with a worse prognosis. However, current data on histologies are too sparse to reach any definite conclusion. In a series of 34 LFS and LFL families, Birch et al., (35) have reported an association of brain tumor and breast cancer with missense mutations in the DNAbinding domain (35). Our analysis of a larger series of families (which include the 34 families reported by Birch et al.) revealed a new association between adrenocortical carcinoma and group 3 mutations, and confirmed the association of brain tumor with genotype, refining it to the L2/L3 loops of the p53 protein, which bind to the minor groove of DNA. For breast cancer, although we did not find an association with a particular structure-group of mutations, we found that mutations in the DNA-binding domain were associated with tumors of earlier onset.
It is possible that tissue-specific factors influence the expression of p53 mutant properties. A striking example of this has been described recently for the inherited TP53 mutation, R337H, which predisposes exclusively to childhood adrenocortical carcinoma (36). A functional assessment of this mutant has shown that its activity is pH-sensitive, i.e. inactive (mutant-like) at pH 7.7 and active (wt like) at pH 7.7 (37). Thus, the protein may adopt a mutant phenotype only under particular physiological conditions. Although this does not explain the tissue specificity of the R337H mutant, this example illustrates the dependence of p53 protein function on the cellular context in which it is expressed. In our analysis, adrenocortical carcinoma was associated with codons located in the opposite side of the DNA-binding surface of the protein. These residues are three conserved prolines not frequently mutated in sporadic human cancers (codons 151, 152, and 219) and a conserved tyrosine (codon 220) frequently mutated in head and neck cancers (IARC TP53 Database4). Functional assays have shown that these mutants have defective transcriptional activities (22, 23, 38). The particular clustering of residues may suggest that mutation in this region of the protein lead to specific loss or gain of function, which would promote preferentially (but not exclusively) adrenocortical carcinoma. However, additional studies on a larger number of cases would be necessary to verify this finding. The excess of brain tumor in individuals with group 1 mutations is interesting, because the main hotspot codon for sporadic brain tumors is at codon 273, corresponding to a group 2 mutation. Group 1 and 2 mutations correspond to the two functional segments of the DNA-binding domain of the p53 protein (see Fig. 4). Overall, these results indicate that alteration of direct protein-DNA contacts is important in the pathogenesis of brain tumors and that the consequence of this alteration may differ, depending which functional segment is affected.
The analysis performed here has clinical implications for the management of families with germ-line TP53 mutations. The finding that breast cancers occur 8 years earlier in LFS families with TP53 mutations than in those families without mutations argues in favor of an earlier clinical surveillance program for such families, starting in the early twenties. The precise screening schedule is controversial, but many centers would advocate annual clinical examination. Magnetic imaging of the breast is being investigated for this purpose in clinical trials (39). For adrenocortical tumors, some centers advocate annual abdominal ultrasonography in children. Our findings suggest that such a surveillance program would be particularly important in families with structural group 3 TP53 mutations. Additional exploitation of molecular TP53 data for clinical purposes awaits a global approach to integrate structural biology, functional assessment of mutants, and the
