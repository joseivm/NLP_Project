Recently, RAD51C mutations were identified in families with breast and ovarian cancer1. This observation prompted us to investigate the role of RAD51D in cancer susceptibility. We identified eight inactivating RAD51D mutations in unrelated individuals from 911 breast-ovarian cancer families compared with one inactivating mutation identified in 1,060 controls (P = 0.01). The association found here was principally with ovarian cancer, with three mutations identified in the 59 pedigrees with three or more individuals with ovarian cancer (P = 0.0005). The relative risk of ovarian cancer for RAD51D mutation carriers was estimated to be 6.30 (95% CI 2.86­13.85, P = 4.8 × 10­6). By contrast, we estimated the relative risk of breast cancer to be 1.32 (95% CI 0.59­2.96, P = 0.50). These data indicate that RAD51D mutation testing may have clinical utility in individuals with ovarian cancer and their families. Moreover, we show that cells deficient in RAD51D are sensitive to treatment with a PARP inhibitor, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach for cancers arising in RAD51D mutation carriers.

Homologous recombination is a mechanism for repairing stalled replication forks, DNA interstrand crosslinks and double-strand breaks2. Constitutional inactivating mutations in several genes that encode proteins crucial for DNA repair by homologous recombination have been shown to predispose to cancer3. In particular, these mutations have a strong association with female cancers, and mutations in genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD50 and RAD51C have been shown to confer susceptibility to breast and/or ovarian cancer1,4. Indeed, the analysis of families with breast and ovarian cancer was crucial to mapping BRCA1 (ref. 5). For many years, it was widely believed that the genetic contribution to families with breast and ovarian cancer was largely attributable to mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (refs. 6­8). Last year, however, researchers1 identified mutations in RAD51C in breast-ovarian cancer families. This suggested that analysis of such families may still have utility in the discovery of cancer predisposition genes.
In eukaryotic cells, DNA repair by homologous  recombination involves several proteins, of which a central player is the DNA

Our data clearly show that RAD51D is an ovarian cancer predisposition gene, but further studies in familial and sporadic ovarian cancer series would be of value to further clarify the risks of ovarian cancer. RAD51D mutation analysis in individuals with Fanconi anemia and Fanconi-like disorders would also be of interest, given that biallelic mutations in BRCA2, PALB2, BRIP1 and RAD51C have been shown to cause these phenotypes15­18.
Our discovery has potential clinical utility both for individuals with cancer and their relatives. For example, cancer patients with RAD51D mutations may benefit from specific therapies such as poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which have shown efficacy in patients with impaired homologous recombination caused by mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (ref. 19). To investigate this, we used RNA interference (RNAi) and assessed the relationship between RAD51D loss of function and the sensitivity of tumor cells to a clinical PARP inhibitor, olaparib (AstraZeneca). Short interfering RNAi (siRNAi) reagents targeting RAD51D caused olaparib sensitivity of a magnitude similar to that achieved following silencing of BRCA2 (Fig. 3a,b), an observation in keeping with the homologous recombination defect observed in Rad51d-null rodent cell lines20. To extend this analysis, we also observed the RAD51D-selective effect of olaparib in RAD51Ddeficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which both alleles of RAD51D had been rendered dysfunctional by gene targeting (Fig. 3c)20. These data suggest that PARP inhibitors may have clinical utility in individuals with RAD51D mutations. We estimate that only ~0.6% of unselected individuals with ovarian cancer will harbor RAD51D mutations, but as we enter an era in which genetic testing will become routine, such individuals will be readily identifiable. Their identification will also be of potential value to female relatives, as those relatives with mutations will be, on average, at an approximately sixfold increased risk of ovarian cancer, which equates to an ~10% cumulative risk by age 80. An appreciable proportion of women at this level of risk may consider strategies such as laparoscopic oophorectomy, which is well tolerated and is undertaken in many women with BRCA mutations21.

ONLINE METHODS Cases. We used lymphocyte DNA from 1,648 families with breast-ovarian cancer or breast cancer only. These families were ascertained from 24 genetics centers in the UK through the Genetics of Familial Breast Cancer Study (FBCS), which recruits women 18 years of age who have had breast and/or ovarian cancer and have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. At least 97% of the families studied are of European ancestry. Index cases from each family were screened and were negative for germline mutations, including large rearrangements, in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and the research was approved by the London Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC/01/2/18). Breast-ovarian cancer pedigrees. We included 911 unrelated index cases from breast-ovarian cancer pedigrees. The index cases were diagnosed with breast and/or ovarian cancer. Each family contained an individual with both breast and ovarian cancer or contained at least one case of breast cancer and at least one case of ovarian cancer with 1 intervening unaffected female relative. Cases of ovarian cancer below the age of 20 were excluded from the analysis, as an appreciable proportion of these cases are likely to represent nonepithelial ovarian tumors, for example germ cell cancers. Of the 911 probands, 271 had ovarian cancer (with or without breast cancer) and 617 had breast cancer only. The number of family members (including the probands) diagnosed with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer in the 911 breast-ovarian cancer pedigrees included in the analysis is shown in Supplementary Table 2. Breast-cancer­only pedigrees. We included 737 unrelated index cases from breast cancer­only pedigrees. The index case from each family was diagnosed with breast cancer and had bilateral disease and/or a family history of breast cancer. There was no known case of ovarian cancer in any of these pedigrees. The number of family members (including the probands) diagnosed with breast cancer in the 737 breast cancer­only pedigrees included in the analysis is shown in Supplementary Table 2. The six cases of isolated breast cancer all had bilateral disease. Samples and pathology information from mutation-positive families. For families in which a mutation in RAD51D was detected, we sought DNA samples from relatives, and we genotyped all obtainable samples for the family mutation. We also requested tumor material, pathology information and receptor status in probands and affected relatives from the hospitals where they had been treated. Controls. We used lymphocyte DNA from 1,060 population-based controls obtained from the 1958 Birth Cohort Collection, an ongoing follow-up of persons born in Great Britain during one week in 1958. Biomedical assessment was undertaken during 2002­2004, at which blood samples and informed consent were obtained for the creation of a genetic resource; phenotype data for these individuals were not available (see URLs). At least 97% of the controls were of European ancestry. Mutation analysis of RAD51D. We analyzed genomic DNA extracted from lymphocytes for mutations by direct sequencing of the full coding sequence and the intron-exon boundaries of RAD51D. Primer sequences and PCR conditions are given in Supplementary Table 1. The PCR reactions were performed in multiplex using the QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplicons were unidirectionally sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI3730 automated sequencer (ABI PerkinElmer). Sequencing traces were analyzed using Mutation Surveyor software (see URLs) and by visual inspection. All mutations were confirmed by bidirectional sequencing from a fresh aliquot of the stock DNA. Samples from members of RAD51D-mutation­positive families were tested for the family mutation by direct sequencing of the a ppropriate exon. In silico analyses of identified variants. We computed the predicted effects of RAD51D missense variants on protein function using PolyPhen24 and SIFT25. All variants (intronic and coding) were analyzed for their potential effect on splicing. Variants were analyzed using two splice prediction

algorithms, NNsplice26 and MaxEntScan27, using the Alamut software interface (Interactive Biosoftware). If both the NNsplice and MaxEntScan scores were altered by >20% (that is, a wild-type splice-site score decreased and/or a cryptic splice-site score increased), three further prediction algorithms were used; NetGene2 (ref. 28), HumanSplicingFinder29 and GENSCAN30. A consen sus decrease in a wild-type splice-site score and/or a consensus increase in a cryptic splice-site score across all algorithms was considered indicative of disruption of normal splicing. Tumor analysis. Representative tumor sections were stained with Nuclear Fast Red and microdissected using a sterile needle and a stereomicroscope (Olympus SZ61) to ensure that the proportion of tumor cells was >90%, as previously described31. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentration was mea sured using the PicoGreen assay (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RAD51D-specific fragments encompassing the relevant mutations were PCR amplified using the primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 and bidirectionally sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit and an ABI3730 automated sequencer (ABI PerkinElmer). Sequence traces from tumor DNA were compared to sequence traces from lymphocyte DNA from the same individual. Drug sensitivity. We used nonsilencing BRCA2 and RAD51D siGENOME siRNAs (Dharmacon). CAL51 and MCF7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (Gibco, Invitrogen). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) RAD51D wild-type (51D1.3 clone) and RAD51D dysfunctional (51D1 clone) cells were grown in MEM (Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco, Invitrogen). Cells were siRNA transfected using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), plated in 96-well microtiter plates and then exposed to a titration of olaparib for 7 days. The media and drug were replenished every 3 days. After 7 days of continuous culture, cell viability was estimated using CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega), and surviving fractions were calculated as previously described32. Statistical methods. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata v11 software (StataCorp). The frequency of mutations in cases and controls was compared using a two-sided Fisher's exact test. We estimated the RAD51D combined mutation frequency, the breast cancer risk ratio and the ovarian cancer risk ratio relative to non-RAD51D mutation carriers simultaneously using modified segregation analysis implemented in the pedigree analysis software MENDEL33. The analysis was based on breast and ovarian cancer occurrence in the combined dataset of families and controls. All individuals were censored at age 80 years, the age of their first cancer or their age of death or last observation, whichever occurred first. Females who had bilateral prophylactic mastectomy were censored for breast cancer, and those who had had bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy were censored for ovarian cancer. Thus, only information on the first cancer was included in the primary analysis. We assumed that the breast cancer incidence depends on the underlying genotype through a model of the form: (t)=0(t)exp(x), where 0(t) is the baseline incidence at age t in nonmutation carriers,  is the log risk ratio associated with the mutation and x takes value 0 for nonmutation carriers and 1 for mutation carriers. A similar model was assumed for the ovarian cancer incidences. Breast and ovarian cancers were assumed to occur independently, conditional on the genotype22. The overall breast and ovarian cancer incidences were constrained to agree with the population incidences for England and Wales in the period of 1993­1997 (ref. 23), as described previously34,35. The models were parameterized in terms of the mutation frequencies and log-risk ratios for breast and ovarian cancer. Parameters were estimated using a maximum likelihood estimation. Because RAD51D mutation screening was carried out in all index cases and controls, we were able to incorporate information from all controls and the full pedigrees from all cases (including those without a RAD51D mutation) together with the segregation information from the families in which a RAD51D mutation was detected and genotyping was possible in relatives of the index case. To adjust for ascertainment, we modeled the conditional likelihood of all family phenotypes and mutation status of the index family member and other tested

family members given the disease phenotypes of all family members. For the controls, we modeled the likelihood of the mutation status given that they were unaffected. The variances of the parameters were obtained by inverting the observed information matrix. Log risk ratios were assumed to be normally distributed. Because this model does not explicitly incorporate the effects of other susceptibility genes, it assumes implicitly that the effects of RAD51D and other potential susceptibility genes can be regarded as independent, as in a multiplicative model.
Power calculations were based on two-sided association testing with a significance level of  = 0.05. We assumed that the observed frequency of truncating mutations in cases from breast-ovarian cancer families (0.88%) and controls (0.094%) reflects the true underlying mutation frequencies in the population, and that the effect calculated from the segregation analysis (odds ratio = 6.30) represents the true risk of ovarian cancer in the population. We assumed that the same ratio of truncating mutations to missense variants (predicted deleterious) would be detected in isolated cases of ovarian cancer as in cases from breast-ovarian cancer families. We assumed that in association testing of mutation frequencies across 25,000 genes, the 2 statistics would be normally distributed, and we applied a Bonferroni correction for multiple testing.
