Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare chromosomal-instability disorder associated with a variety of developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure and predisposition to leukemia and other cancers1. We have identified a homozygous missense mutation in the RAD51C gene in a consanguineous family with multiple severe congenital abnormalities characteristic of FA. RAD51C is a member of the RAD51-like gene family involved in homologous recombination­mediated DNA repair. The mutation results in loss of RAD51 focus formation in response to DNA damage and in increased cellular sensitivity to the DNA interstrand crosslinking agent mitomycin C and the topoisomerase-1 inhibitor camptothecin. Thus, biallelic germline mutations in a RAD51 paralog are associated with an FA-like syndrome.
FA is a highly heterogeneous disorder, arising from biallelic mutations in one of at least 13 different genes (FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, BRCA2 (FANCD1), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCI, BRIP1 (FANCJ), FANCL, FANCM and PALB2 (FANCN); ref. 1). A key step in the FA pathway is monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI, which requires the presence of a core complex of FA and FA-associated proteins. This post-translational modification is intact in FA groups D1, J and N, which therefore appear to function downstream of the core and I-D2 complexes1. Most individuals diagnosed with FA have germline defects in one of the known FA genes. However, identification of the causal genetic defects in the small minority of individuals with unclassified FA may offer important insights into the function of the FA pathway in inherited disorders and cancer.
The pedigree and genetic analysis of the family investigated in this study is shown in Figure 1 and clinical and laboratory details are summarized in Table 1. The parents of the affected children are first cousins of Pakistani origin (Fig. 1a). A daughter (IV-3) died at

2 months of age with multiple congenital abnormalities, including one absent and one vestigial thumb, a congenital heart defect, imperforate anus and hydronephrosis. Her lymphocytes showed elevated chromosome breakage after treatment with the DNA interstrand cross-linking (ICL) agent mitomycin C (MMC), indicating a diagnosis of FA. A son (IV-2) died 2 d after birth with congenital abnormalities similar

and the cell cycle assay. The effect of the mutation was also tested in chicken RAD51C-DT40 cells in which the RAD51C ortholog is disrupted by recombination6. Expression of human wild-type RAD51C complemented the sensitivity of RAD51C-mutant cells to MMC, whereas expression from the human RAD51C cDNA with the G773A mutation did not (Fig. 2i). The specificity of correction of the MMCsensitive phenotype was confirmed further by the finding that expression of wild-type RAD51C cDNA in 18 FA cell lines from different upstream and downstream complementation groups did not rescue the characteristic G2 arrest in any of these cell lines (data not shown). These data verify that RAD51C is the gene responsible for the cellular phenotype in this family and that R258H is the causal mutation. We suggest a provisional assignment for the FA in this family as FA-O.
We investigated the possible structural effect of the R258H mutation by homology-modeling the structure of RAD51C from the crystal structure of the archaeal rad51 protein of Pyrococcus furiosus7 (PDB 1PZN; Online Methods). The arginine residue 258 is located on helix 13 in close proximity to helix 12 and faces residues Ser304 and Glu303 of the loop-connecting strands 5 and 6 (ref. 7). In the wildtype protein, Arg258 is in close contact (hydrogen-bond distance) with the carbonyl backbone of Glu303. Substitution of arginine with histidine in the model disrupts this interaction (Supplementary Fig. 3) and changes the electrostatic surface of this region from slightly positive to slightly negative. Together, these structural perturbations could result in rearrangement of the neighboring secondary structure

elements, with relative displacement of the N-terminal and ATPase domains, and thus may affect higher-order structures such as the heptameric ring described for archaeal rad51 (ref. 7). The mutation does not appear to have a major effect on the stability of the protein, as the protein was readily detectable in the affected individual's fibroblasts on protein blots (data not shown).
As the loss of functional RAD51C protein in eukaryotic cells is associated with impaired formation of RAD51 foci in response to DNA damage4­6, we looked for this phenotype in cells from subject IV-5. We found that RAD51 focus formation in response to MMC treatment was greatly reduced in the affected individual's fibroblasts and that this defect was corrected by transduction with wild-type RAD51C (Fig. 2j). This result strongly supports the genetic and functional complementation data that identified loss of RAD51C function as the primary defect in this family. The effect of the RAD51C mutation on RAD51 focus formation is shared with two of the downstream FA complementation groups, FA-D1 and FA-N, caused by mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2, respectively, which encode two proteins that themselves have important roles in homologous recombination­based DNA repair8. The loss of RAD51 focus formation in response to interstrand cross-link­induced DNA damage prompted us to test fibroblasts from subject IV-5 for sensitivity to irradiation. As found in other FA complementation groups, the cells showed only modest radiosensitivity, which was, however, complemented by transduction with wild-type RAD51C (Supplementary Table 2). We also tested lymphoblastoid cells

SH2038-L cells were tested for CPT sensitivity before transduction (no virus) or after transduction with control virus (no RAD51C insert), RAD51C with the R258H mutation, or wild-type RAD51C. Results for CPT-sensitive FA lymphoblastoid cell lines from FA groups FA-D1 and FA-N, and from a normal control line, are shown for comparison. The CPT sensitivity of SH2038-L is complemented by wild-type but not by mutant RAD51C (data shown is the mean plus or minus the one-sided s.d. from four experiments).

(SH2038-L) from the affected individual for sensitivity to the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin, as cells from other downstream FA groups, FA-D1 and FA-N (and FANCM-deficient cells), have recently been shown to be sensitive to this agent9. The RAD51C-deficient cells did show increased camptothecin sensitivity, which was corrected by wild-type RAD51C but not by cDNAs encoding the R258H mutant (Fig. 3). Although the camptothecin sensitivity was less marked in the affected individual's cells than in the FA-D1 and FA-N lines, these data are consistent with an FA core complex­independent role for RAD51C in addition to BRCA2, PALB2 and FANCM (ref. 9).
This study is, to our knowledge, the first report of the association of a mutation in RAD51C with a human disorder. The rarity of RAD51C mutations in humans is consistent with the fact that absence of Rad51c in mice causes early embryonic lethality, and there is partial embryonic lethality in Rad51cko/+ mice10, whereas a hypomorphic Rad51c mouse model that expressed 5­30% of normal levels of the protein had normal growth and development but reduced fertility11. Thus the R258H mutation in this family may be associated with some residual function of RAD51C, as suggested by partial correction of cell cycle arrest in the hamster cell line irs3. Nonetheless, affected family members have experienced severe congenital abnormalities, some of which, such as imperforate anus and cystic kidneys with renal failure, have also been described in individuals with FA having bilateral mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 (ref. 1). However, the absence of malignancies in subject IV-5 at the age of 10 years suggests that RAD51C deficiency may be associated with a less cancer-susceptible phenotype than that in the FA groups FA-D1 and FA-N.
RAD51C is known to have an important role in RAD51-mediated recombination12,13 and recently has been shown to persist at sites of DNA damage after disassembly of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments14. However, it also appears to be required for activation of the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage14. These characteristics suggest that RAD51C and the other RAD51 paralogs may merit screening as candidate genes in families with FA-like disease and in familial cancers with undefined mutations. Indeed, in a companion paper in this issue, we demonstrate the presence of truncating and missense mutations in RAD51C in familial breast and ovarian cancer15.

ONLINE METHODS Samples and cell lines. The family in question was referred to the Department of Clinical Genetics at Guy's Hospital. We took blood samples and skin biopsy specimens, after obtaining informed consent for all participants and ethical board approval (07/Q0702/69), to test for chromosome breakage, to obtain genomic DNA and to generate cell lines. Fibroblasts (SH2038-F) were grown from pieces of the skin explant, and a lymphoblast cell line (SH2038-L) was established by ex vivo EBV transformation of B lymphocytes. Since the family originated from the Lahore region of Pakistan, we obtained a panel of 47 control DNAs established by the Department of Pathology at the Army Medical College (Rawalpindi, Pakistan) to test for the presence of the RAD51C R258H mutation. Rad51c-DT40 cells were purchased from the Riken BRC Cell Bank. Rad51c-deficient irs3 cells were kindly provided from J. Thacker5 by G. Illiakis.
Chromosome breakage test. Chromosome breakage analysis was performed according to established protocols16. Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood was cultured either with or without MMC at a final concentration of 30 ng/ml, or with or without DEB at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, for 48­72 h in parallel with an identically treated healthy control sample. We analyzed the resulting metaphase spreads by light microscopy and scored them for chromosomal instability. We compared the affected individual's results with those of the control and established laboratory ranges. Cultured fibroblasts (SH2038-F) were tested similarly but using a 36-h exposure to MMC at a final concentration of 10 ng/ml.
Radiosensitivity assay. Confluent primary fibroblasts were trypsinized, centrifuged and resuspended at 2 × 105 per milliliter in MEM media. Aliquots were transferred into CryoTube vials and irradiated with 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 or 5 Gy using a 6-MV linear accelerator (Siemens) as photon source. We plated cells in triplicate into 60-mm Petri dishes at 500­6,000 cells per dish, depending on the irradiation dose applied. Earle's MEM with 15% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum was replaced every 3­4 d. After a growth period of 2 weeks, colonies (>20 cells) were stained with 1% (wt/vol) crystal violet in 20% (vol/vol) ethanol. Clones were counted on a projection screen. Means and standard errors of the ratio of colony number relative to the number of seeded cells were calculated individually and plotted as colony survival fraction versus radiation dosage. We derived survival data from three separate experiments. Cell lines studied were RAD51C-deficient SH2038-F cells and their RAD51C-complemented isogenic counterparts; ataxia telangiectasia Aa026 (ref. 17), DNA-ligase IVdeficient GYMN (ref. 18) and RAD50-deficient F239 (ref. 19) cell lines were included as radiosensitive controls. We fitted dose-response curves to the linear quadratic model SF = exp(-aX ­ bX2), where SF is the survival fraction, X the radiation dose, and a and b are fitted parameters. We did calculations using Origin 5.0 (MicroCal Software) and generated graphs using SigmaPlot 10 (Systat Software).
Camptothecin sensitivity of RAD51C-deficient cells. The lymphoblast cell line from the index individual (SH2038-L) was transduced with control virus or vectors expressing either the wild-type RAD51C or the mutant RAD51C R258H cDNAs. G418 resistant cells (3 × 105) were exposed to increasing doses (0, 1, 3.3, 10, 33.3 and 100 nM) of camptothecin (Sigma). After 5 d the cultures were harvested, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience). For each data point, we collected 104 events using the CellQuest software. Results are shown for three or four different experiments as mean ± s.d. Survival of SH2038-L cells was compared with that of the PALB2-deficient (FA-N) LNEY cell line20, the BRCA2-deficient (FA-D1) FA62 cell line21 and a normal control, LCL (ref. 22).
Cell cycle analysis. We exposed native or transduced cells to 36 nM (12 ng/ml; fibroblasts, irs3 cells) or 45 nM (15 ng/ml; blood lymphocytes, lymphoblastoid cells) MMC for 48 h, harvested them and stained them with 4-6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a final concentration of 1 µg/ml in a buffer containing 154 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 M Tris, 0.2% (wt/vol) BSA and 0.1% (vol/vol) NP40 for 30 min in the dark. Alternatively, we fixed cells with 70% (vol/vol) methanol for at least 1 h at -20 °C, resuspended them in PBS and stained them with propidium iodide at a final concentration of

50 µg/ml while treating them with 25 U/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. We recorded univariate flow histograms on an analytical, triple-laserequipped flow cytometer (LSRII, Becton Dickinson) using 355-nm Lightwave solid-state modelock laser excitation of the DAPI dye or sapphire 488-nm solid-state laser excitation of propidium iodide. We quantified the resulting cell cycle distributions, reflecting cellular DNA content, using the MPLUS AV software package (Phoenix Flow Systems).
Phenotypic correction of FA cells by retroviral transduction. The control vector S11IN, expressing an IRES-nptII cassette, and the vector S11RCIN, expressing additionally wild-type RAD51C cDNA, were constructed using methods previously described (ref. 23 and Supplementary Fig. 2). We generated the S11IP and the S11RCIP vectors by replacing neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) with puromycin N-acetyl-transferase (pac) cDNA using standard procedures. The missense mutation encoding the G773A substitution was introduced using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of stable oncoretroviral cell lines and transduction of adherent and nonadherent cells were performed as described22,24,25. Transduced cells were selected in G418 or puromycin for 7­14 d, challenged with MMC and then assayed by flow cytometry. We analyzed transduced human fibroblasts and irs3 cells by cell cycle analysis for rescue of G2-phase arrest as described above. We analyzed Rad51c-DT40 cells for survival rates after 3 d, in increasing concentrations of MMC, using propidium iodide to discriminate live cells from dead cells as described22.
Immunoblotting. We performed immunoblots with samples containing 50 µg of total protein on 7% or 3­8% (for BRCA2) NuPage Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Membranes were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-FANCD2 (1:800; Santa Cruz sc-20022), rabbit polyclonal anti-BRIP1 (1:1,000; Novus NB100-416) or rabbit polyclonal anti-BRCA2 (1:500; Calbiochem PC146). Rabbit polyclonal anti-PALB2 (1:1,000) was a kind gift of B. Xia. Secondary antibodies included sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare RPN4201) or donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare NA934V). We used these horseradish peroxidase­linked whole antibodies at dilutions of 1:2,000 to 1:5,000 and detected them by the chemiluminescence technique using the ECL system (Amersham).
Immunofluorescence. We analyzed the capability of SH2038-F primary fibro blasts to form nuclear RAD51 foci as follows. Cells were grown on glass slides, and subconfluent cultures were exposed to 50 ng/ml of MMC for 15 h for foci induction. The cells were fixed in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 6.8) for 15 min on ice and permeabilized with 0.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min on ice. After blocking with 0.5% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum and washing in PBS, we incubated the slides with monospecific rabbit polyclonal anti-RAD51 as the primary antibody (1:800; Abcam, ab 63801). Secondary antibody was Alexa594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, A-11037). The cells were counterstained with DAPI in Vectorshield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). We determined the percentage of foci-positive cells (more than ten foci per nucleus) visually on a Zeiss Axio Imager.A1 fluorescence microscope. For each experiment, 200­400 nuclei were analyzed.
SNP genotyping. We undertook genome-wide linkage analysis using the GeneChip Human Mapping 10K Array Xba 142 2.0, containing 10,204 SNP markers. The median intermarker distance was 113 kb, and the mean hetero zygosity of markers was 0.38. We obtained genotypes using the Affymetrix protocol for the GeneChip Mapping 10K Xba array and images using an Affymetrix Gene Chip Scanner 3000. Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software 1.4 software was used to obtain raw allele scores. We processed scores using Affymetrix GeneChip Genotyping Analysis Software (GTYPE) to derive SNP genotypes. Genotype calls were analyzed with AutoSNPa26, which allows visualization of genotype data across each chromosome for rapid autozygosity mapping.
DNA sequencing. We designed primers to amplify the nine exons and intron-exon boundaries of RAD51C. Primers and PCR conditions are shown in Supplementary Table 3. For DNA sequencing of PCR products, we used the BigDye v3.1 cycle sequencing kit and a 3730XL DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).

Modeling RAD51C structure. We modeled RAD51C structure by homology from the crystal structure of the archaeal Rad51 protein from P. furiosus (PDB 1PZN)7. We produced the sequence alignment used to build the model using PRALINE with the homology-extended alignment strategy27. We generated three-dimensional models using the MODELLER package28. The selected model was chosen on the basis of the MODELLER objective function's score. We obtained the in silico mutant R258H using the PyMOL mutagenesis tool (DeLano Scientific). To refine both the model and the in silico mutant, we performed energy minimizations with the GROMACS package29 using the GROMOS96 force field30.
