Background: Germline mutations in SMAD4 and BMPR1A disrupt the transforming growth factor  signal transduction pathway, and are associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome. The effect of genotype on the pattern of disease in this syndrome is unknown. This study evaluated the differential impact of SMAD4 and BMPR1A gene mutations on cancer risk and oncological phenotype in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome. Methods: Patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome and germline SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutations were identified from a prospectively maintained institutional registry. Medical records were reviewed and the clinical patterns of disease were analysed. Results: Thirty-five patients had germline mutations in either BMPR1A (8 patients) or SMAD4 (27). Median follow-up was 11 years. Colonic phenotype was similar between patients with SMAD4 and BMPR1A mutations, whereas SMAD4 mutations were associated with larger polyp numbers (number of patients with 50 or more gastric polyps: 14 versus 0 respectively). The numbers of patients with rectal polyps was comparable between BMPR1A and SMAD4 mutation carriers (5 versus 17). No patient was diagnosed with cancer in the BMPR1A group, whereas four men with a SMAD4 mutation developed gastrointestinal (3) or extraintestinal (1) cancer. The gastrointestinal cancer risk in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome and a SMAD4 mutation was 11 per cent (3 of 27). Conclusion: The SMAD4 genotype is associated with a more aggressive upper gastrointestinal malignancy risk in juvenile polyposis syndrome.

Introduction
Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by predisposition to hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract1. Polyps can be found in the stomach, small intestine, colon and rectum2. In the majority of patients with JPS, germline mutations in one of two genes involved in the transforming growth factor (TGF)  signal transduction pathway can be identified: SMAD4 or BMPR1A (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type Ia)3­5. In addition to intestinal hamartomatous polyposis, approximately 20 per cent of affected patients have congenital anomalies, including heart defects, cleft lip or palate and malrotation6. Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is usually

seen only in patients with JPS who have a SMAD4 mutation7, and has been described as the JPS­HHT overlap syndrome8. Epistaxis and asthma are the most common symptoms in patients with JPS­HHT overlap9. Recent reports9,10 showed an association between mutations in
SMAD4 and BMPR1A and gastrointestinal cancer, as well
as profuse polyposis. The cumulative lifetime risk of gas-
trointestinal cancer in patients with JPS varies between 9 and 50 per cent10,11. However, little is known about the way
in which gastrointestinal phenotype, cancer development
and oncological outcomes vary according to genotype in patients with JPS12. This study investigated the impact
of genotype on cancer risk and oncological phenotype
in patients with JPS with a SMAD4 or BMPR1A gene
mutation.

Methods
After obtaining approval from the institutional review board (IRB), patients with JPS were identified from the IRB-approved, prospectively maintained David G. Jagelman Inherited Colorectal Cancer Registries in the Sanford R. Weiss, M.D. Center for Hereditary Colorectal Neoplasia. Only patients who had either a SMAD4 or BMPR1A mutation were included. Patients who had not undergone genetic testing or in whom no germline mutation could be identified were excluded. Medical records were reviewed to obtain information on cancer history, patient characteristics, operations, and gastric and colonic polyp counts. The development of cancer and dysplastic gastrointestinal polyps in any part of the body was noted. Colorectal and gastric polyposis phenotype was graded (less than 50 polyps, 50 or more polyps) based on the highest polyp number detected during surveillance.
In the authors' clinical practice, intervals of endoscopic surveillance vary between 1 and 3 years according to disease phenotype. Genetic testing is recommended to all patients at the time of genetic counselling. Total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is warranted if severe colonic polyposis with mild rectal involvement (20 or fewer polyps) is present. When the whole colon and rectum is severely affected, total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch­anal anastomosis (IPAA) is indicated7.
Statistical analysis
Continuous data are reported as median (range). Comparisons of SMAD4 and BMPR1A groups were performed using 2 or Fisher's exact tests for categorical data, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for quantitative data. A level of  = 005 was used to establish statistical significance of individual P values.
Results
Thirty-five patients with JPS had either a BMPR1A (8) or SMAD4 (27) mutation. All patients except one with a SMAD4 mutation had the clinical characteristics of JPS13.

The patient with no clinical signs of JPS had a family history of JPS­HHT overlap syndrome. His genetic test was performed at age 3 years and he had been under surveillance for 6 years. He had been diagnosed with an intrapulmonary shunt, suggesting an arteriovenous malformation.
Four patients in the BMPR1A group were related to two families and 20 patients in the SMAD4 group were related to six families. The other patients were not related. Median age at the time of diagnosis was 17 (3­65) years. Overall median follow-up after diagnosis of JPS was 11 (1­33) years. Age, sex, family history and follow-up were comparable between the genotypes (Table 1).
Disease phenotype
Colonic phenotype was similar between the BMPR1A and SMAD4 genotypes (3 versus 14 patients respectively with at least 50 polyps, 5 versus 11 patients with 1­49 polyps, 0 versus 1 patient with no polyps, 0 versus 1 patient with unknown gastrointestinal phenotype; P = 0683), as was the number of patients with rectal polyps (5 versus 17 respectively; P > 0999). However, SMAD4 mutations were associated with higher gastric polyp numbers (0 versus 14 patients in BMPR1A and SMAD4 groups respectively with at least 50 polyps, 5 versus 9 patients with 1­49 polyps, 0 versus 1 patient with no polyps, 3 versus 3 patients with unknown gastrointestinal phenotype; P = 0041).
The numbers of tubular (3 versus 7 in BMPR1A and SMAD4 groups; P = 0661) and tubulovillous (0 versus 3 respectively; P > 0999) adenomas removed endoscopically during follow-up were similar between the groups. High-grade dysplasia was rare, found in one patient in each genotype group (P = 0410).
In addition to routine lower gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, 13 capsule endoscopies, two push enteroscopies and one balloon enteroscopy were performed. Small bowel juvenile polyps were diagnosed in 14 patients with SMAD4 and two with BMPR1A mutations (P = 0244). Locations of the small bowel polyps were: duodenum (7 patients; range 02­25 cm), jejunum (1 patient; multiple, range 05­07 cm), ileum (3 patients; range 02­08 cm) and unknown location (4 patients; size unknown). One patient

had small bowel polyps in both the duodenum (02 cm) and jejunum (05 cm). One patient was diagnosed with a juvenile polyp located at the cricopharyngeus (11 cm).

Operations
The number of operations performed was comparable between patients with BMPR1A and SMAD4 mutations (Table 2). Most patients underwent a restorative

proctocolectomy or a subtotal/total colectomy to control colonic polyposis. In two patients with a SMAD4 mutation a right colectomy and a transverse colectomy were performed for tubulovillous adenomas that could not be excised endoscopically. Total gastrectomy was carried out in seven patients with a SMAD4 mutation, but no patient with a BMPR1A mutation. Indications for gastrectomy were chronic anaemia (3), severe polyposis (3) and dysplasia (1). One patient in the BMPR1A group underwent adhesiolysis and a small bowel resection 7 years after IPAA surgery owing to adhesive bowel disease.
Cancer phenotype
No patient with a BMPR1A mutation was diagnosed with cancer, but four men with a SMAD4 mutation developed cancer (Table 3). Two parents were followed up at an outside clinic until the diagnosis of cancer, whereas the others were under surveillance in the authors' institution. The gastrointestinal cancer risk in patients with JPS and a SMAD4 mutation was 11 per cent (3 of 27).
Discussion
Previous studies have shown that JPS carries a 50 per cent cumulative lifetime risk of developing colorectal and/or gastric cancer11,14. An association between colorectal cancer and BMPR1A mutation has been shown by the St Vincent's Hospital Group in Dublin4 and others15. The present study did not confirm these findings, because patients had successful prophylaxis and surveillance; here, extracolonic cancers were found only in patients with a SMAD4 mutation. This is in keeping with a generally more severe upper gastrointestinal polyp phenotype associated with a germline SMAD4 but not with a germline BMPR1A mutation.

Genotype and cancer risk in juvenile polyposis

117

BMPR1A mediates the growth-suppressing TGF- signal transduction pathway, a key intermediary of which is SMAD44,5,16. The importance of SMAD4 in preventing carcinogenesis was first suggested by Vogelstein and colleagues17­19 in 1988; although there are some reports to the contrary20, it is suggested that an allelic imbalance at the SMAD4/DPC4 gene locus may play a key role in the progression of sporadic colorectal carcinoma21. It is not surprising, therefore, that adenomatous polyps can occur in patients with JPS5,22,23, or that 8 per cent of polyps sent to pathology from patients with JPS are dysplastic12. There are no high-quality trials of polyp surveillance in JPS24, but there are some reports of reduced incidence25 and mortality26 from colorectal cancer following polypectomy. The present data show equivalence of colorectal polyposis between the two major JPS genotypes.
As with familial adenomatous polyposis, the small intestine is at risk of cancer in JPS. Polyps and cancer can originate from the small bowel or ileal pouch in patients who have undergone gastrectomy or IPAA27­29. Complete small bowel imaging is not part of routine surveillance in JPS12. The authors generally reserve use of small bowel studies for patients who are symptomatic during surveillance. Although one patient with a SMAD4 mutation developed a small bowel cancer in this series, this is not enough to make any comment about differences in small bowel cancer risk associated with genotype.
The main finding of the present study was the predominance of severe gastric polyposis in SMAD4 mutation carriers. This translated into gastric cancer in two patients and a disproportionate incidence of gastrectomy among SMAD4 mutation carriers. Considering the similar findings of previous studies12 reporting increased risk of gastric polyposis and tendency for gastric cancer development in patients with JPS and SMAD4 mutation, one implication of the present study is that upper gastrointestinal surveillance may be tailored according to genotype. This is already the case for HHT7,12. When indicated by profuse, uncontrollable or rapidly increasing polyposis, prophylactic or therapeutic total gastrectomy and total proctocolectomy may eliminate the risk of gastric and colorectal cancer. This is extreme, and it does not totally eliminate cancer risk.
Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and small patient numbers. However, it has been shown that judicious surgery and effective surveillance can prevent colorectal cancer over a median follow-up of 11 years. This allows extracolonic cancers to develop; five such tumours are reported here, all of which were found in SMAD4 mutation carriers who also had more severe gastric polyposis.
